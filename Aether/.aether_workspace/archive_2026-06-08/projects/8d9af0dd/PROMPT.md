            ## Assignment: The Geometry of Consensus: Arrow's Theorem as Curvature

            Lead a research team to maximize scientific output per cycle. ORGANIZE as: (1) Hypothesis Team — brainstorm 3-5 bold, falsifiable conjectures; (2) Experiment Team — prove or disprove each hypothesis in Lean 4; (3) Analysis Team — examine what survived, what failed, and WHY failures failed — failures teach as much as successes; (4) Writing Team — produce all deliverables (article, paper, demos, HTML widgets) from the team's findings. SCIENCE IS A LOOP: explore → identify patterns → hypothesize → validate → upgrade knowledge → repeat. Each subagent contributes its expertise; the Writing Team synthesizes everything into polished output. More minds = more compute = deeper results.

            ## Research Cycle: Explore → Pattern → Hypothesize → Validate → Upgrade → Repeat

            You are part of an autonomous research system that runs continuously.
            Each cycle's output feeds the next cycle's input in a positive feedback loop.
            Your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md determines what the next cycle investigates.
            The quality of your directions determines the quality of future research.

            Follow this cycle model:
            1. **Explore** — Survey what exists, find gaps, identify anomalies.
            2. **Pattern** — Detect structures, connections, and regularities.
            3. **Hypothesize** — Propose falsifiable conjectures bold enough to matter
               and specific enough to fail. "Study X further" is not a hypothesis.
            4. **Validate** — Prove or disprove. Failures teach as much as successes.
            5. **Upgrade** — Integrate what you learned into the knowledge base.
            6. **Repeat** — Your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md prescribes the next cycle's
               best, most fruitful research directions.

            The Aristotle prompt drives the research directions, which drive results,
            which drive the next Aristotle prompt — a positive, self-aware, intelligent
            feedback loop. Make each cycle count.

            ## Depth Requirements (MANDATORY)

Your output must satisfy ALL of these:

1. **NO trivial proofs**: Do NOT prove statements by `native_decide`, `decide`,
   `norm_num`, or `rfl` unless the statement itself is genuinely important.
   If the only proof tactic is enumeration, the theorem is not worth formalizing.

2. **At least 3 theorems that demonstrate genuine mathematical insight**:
   Your file must contain at least 3 theorems where removing any key step
   would cause the proof to fail. Depth is measured by insight, not tactic count.

3. **Novel definitions**: Define at least one new mathematical structure or concept
   that does not already exist in the Catalog. Check the catalog references to
   confirm novelty.

4. **Conjecture with testable prediction**: State at least one falsifiable
   conjecture with a clear computational test that could disprove it.


            ### Research Direction
            Arrow's impossibility theorem states that no ranked voting system with 3+ alternatives can be Pareto efficient, non-dictatorial, and independent of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Conjecture: Arrow's theorem is a curvature statement. The space of preference profiles is a Riemannian manifold M with the Fisher information metric. The social welfare function F: M -> M is a mapping from profiles to social preferences. Arrow's conditions translate to geometric conditions: (1) Pareto efficiency means F preserves the direction of unanimous preference (F is 'forward-looking'). (2) IIA means F is a local mapping (the social preference at x depends only on local information near x). (3) Non-dictatorial means F is not a projection onto a single voter's preference. Conjecture: the only smooth, local, forward-looking maps on a positively curved manifold are projections (dictatorships). This is because a positively curved manifold has the property that parallel transport around a small loop rotates vectors (Holonomy), and a local, forward-looking map must preserve this holonomy, which forces it to be a projection. Conjecture: the curvature of the preference space is related to the 'polarization' of the electorate: when preferences are polarized (bimodal), the curvature is positive (sphere-like), and Arrow's theorem applies. When preferences are unimodal (consensus), the curvature is zero (flat), and majority rule works. Test: compute the curvature of the preference space for synthetic election data and verify the connection to Arrow's theorem. Impact: Arrow's impossibility is a theorem of differential geometry. Voting is curved.

### Lean 4 Sketch
Define the preference space M = L(S)^n where L(S) is the set of linear orders on the alternative set S = {1, ..., m}. M is a discrete space with |L(S)|^n = (m!)^n points. To make this a manifold, we smooth it: replace each ranking with a utility vector u_i in R^m (normalized to the simplex Delta^{m-1}). The preference space becomes M = (Delta^{m-1})^n (n voters, each with a utility vector on the simplex). The Fisher information metric on M: g_{ij}(u) = E[(d/d u_i) log p(x|u) * (d/d u_j) log p(x|

### Previously Proved Theorems
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


No specific files referenced. Use Mathlib and general knowledge.

            ---

            You are Aristotle. Pursue this research direction deeply and originally.
            Discover what matters. Prove what you can. Define what needs defining.
            Build on the catalog theorems referenced above (FINAL/ entries are vetted, high-quality — prioritize these).

            Choose types appropriate to the problem — abstract where it clarifies,
            concrete where it grounds. Avoid trivial tautologies.
            If a direct proof fails, explore alternative approaches: contrapositive,
            constructive witnesses, categorical arguments, coinduction, computational
            reflection, or structural induction.

            ### Anti-Triviality Rules
            Do NOT produce any of the following:
            - Commutativity/associativity proofs for standard algebraic structures
              UNLESS the result is surprising in context (e.g., proving commutativity
              in a non-obvious setting like tropical semirings or quantum groups)
            - Wrapper theorems that just unwrap a definition without mathematical insight
            - Proofs that are just `by simp` or `by trivial` with no depth
            - Definitions followed by trivial properties that don't advance understanding

            Required: Lean 4 proofs, FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md, RESEARCH_PAPER.md,
                      ARTICLE.md (Scientific American style), algorithm, demo.py,
                      1–3 interactive HTML widgets in PACKAGE.json interactive_demos (each: name, html, description)
            Optional: (none — all key deliverables are mandatory)

            ## Taboo Topics for ARTICLE.md

            The Scientific American-style article MUST NOT focus on formal verification
            or machine verification. Do not write about proof assistants, type theory
            as verification, or mechanized checking — those topics are technical niche
            and alienate a broad audience. Instead, write about the IDEAS: what was
            discovered, why it matters, and what it means for mathematics and science.
            The article should read like a Scientific American feature, not a software
            demo or verification report.

            ## Catalog Context for Future Directions
            Below are key theorems from the Catalog for lineage references.
            Use the **Catalog References** field to cite the exact file paths.

            FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md MUST be a standalone research roadmap. It will be
            used to steer future research rounds WITHOUT access to this cycle's code.
            Each direction must be self-contained: include enough mathematical context,
            definitions, and motivation that a fresh researcher can pick up any
            direction and start working on it immediately. Do NOT assume the reader
            has seen your Lean code.

            FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is critical — it drives the next research cycle.
            Begin with a ## Synthesis section tying all directions together and
            identifying the most promising cross-domain connections from this cycle.
            Then list 3-5 directions (1-2 grand_challenge + 2-3 extension) using:

            ## Synthesis

            [2-3 paragraphs tying all directions together. Identify the most promising
            cross-domain connection from this cycle's discoveries. Explain how the
            cycle's results relate to the broader Catalog. Highlight which direction
            has the highest breakthrough potential and why.]

            ---

            ### Direction 1: [Title]

            Titles MUST be concise research topics (e.g. "Tropical Fermat
            Last Theorem", "Oracle Hierarchy in Computability"), NOT cycle
            summaries (NOT "This research cycle established...").

            **Conjecture**: A precise mathematical statement that can be proved or disproved.
            **Test**: What specific experiment, calculation, or proof attempt would confirm
            or refute this conjecture.
            **Impact**: If true, what new territory does this open? If false, what does
            the failure teach us?
            **Catalog References**: `Bridges.Basic.lean`, `Algebra.QuadraticForms.mordell`
            (Use backtick-enclosed file paths or theorem names from the Catalog.)
            **Proof Strategy**: Outline the key steps or approach. What mathematical
            machinery is needed? What lemmas would need to be established first?
            **Domain Bridges**: (identify genuine cross-domain connections from
            this cycle's results, using the <-> connector.)
            **Lineage**: Builds on fd_XXXX and discoveries from exp_XXXXXXXX_XXX
            (Reference specific prior direction IDs or experiment IDs if known, or
            describe which prior results this extends.)
            **Ambition**: grand_challenge  (or: extension)

            ---

            [repeat for each direction]

            Do real science. Propose hypotheses that are bold enough to matter and
            specific enough to fail. Vague explorations like "study X further" or
            "extend Y" are not hypotheses — they are homework. Give us ideas that
            could change how we think about the problem.

            Pursue truth relentlessly. Soli Deo Gloria.
