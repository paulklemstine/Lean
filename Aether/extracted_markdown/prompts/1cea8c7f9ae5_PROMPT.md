            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are a world-class mathematician. Your ONLY job in this cycle is
to produce **new Lean 4 code that extends the frontier of mathematics**.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by the Plan)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Algebraic–Tropical Canonical Evaluation as a Piecewise-Linear Semiring Bridge
**Domain**: Bridges
**Mathematical framing**: Work in the min-plus semiring viewpoint. An affine piece should be a constant term plus a finite weighted sum of coordinates; its evaluation is a linear form in ordinary addition. A tropical polynomial is then a finite family/list/finset of affine pieces, evaluated as the infimum/minimum of the piece evaluations. The first layer of the project is foundational: prove eval_def lemmas, invariance under permutation/duplicate removal of pieces, monotonicity in coefficients and variables, and a criterion for equality of tropical polynomials via pointwise equality of evaluation. The second layer is the bridge: formulate a finite-presentation reconstruction theorem stating that a tropical polynomial is recovered from its set of affine pieces together with evaluation on points, paralleling finite probe reconstruction for closure systems. Candidate theorems include: (1) evaluation of a singleton tropical polynomial equals the underlying affine evaluation; (2) evaluation of a union/insert of affine pieces is the min of evaluations; (3) if two finite presentations have the same pointwise evaluation on all points, they define the same tropical polynomial function; (4) the map from finite affine-piece presentations to functions is a semiring homomorphism into endofunctions with pointwise tropical operations; (5) finite presentations admit normalization by discarding pointwise-dominated affine pieces, yielding an algorithmic canonical form in simple cases. The falsifiable core is whether these semiring and reconstruction statements can actually be proved with the existing canonical tropical definitions and finite-set machinery.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that the unfinished tropical canonical evaluator can be turned into a genuine bridge theorem: every finite tropical polynomial built from affine pieces admits a well-defined evaluation map that is monotone, respects tropical addition/minimum and tropical multiplication/addition of weights, and can be reconstructed from a finite family of affine pieces as a piecewise-linear semiring object. Why now: Tropical/Canonical/Basic.lean is a priority sorry target with exactly the missing definitions needed for such a theorem, while the catalog already contains strong algebraic closure/reconstruction infrastructure in Bridges/AlgebraEMLClosureComputation.lean and Bridges/AlgebraEMLReconstruction.lean, so this is the right moment to connect a local sorry-fill to a new cross-domain result rather than merely patching definitions. Concretely, define affine pieces and tropical polynomial evaluation, prove extensionality and finite-support evaluation lemmas, then establish a bridge theorem showing that tropical polynomials are determined by their finite affine-piece presentation and that evaluation is compatible with a reconstruction principle analogous to finite closure probes. This matters because it upgrades a blocked tropical foundation into an algorithmic pipeline for canonical tropical evaluation and opens the door to later work on tropical moduli, tropical differential equations, and tropical representation-theoretic objects without repeating already-explored tropical Hodge or tropicalization-of-varieties programs.
**Novelty estimate**: 0.85
**Breakthrough potential**: 0.88
Research domain: Bridges
Research mode: sorry_fill


### Lean 4 Sketch
Implement missing defs and theorems in Tropical/Canonical/Basic.lean first: `AffinePiece`, `AffinePiece.eval`, `AffinePiece.eval_def`, `TropicalPoly`, `TropicalPoly.eval`. Then add a bridge file, likely `Bridges/TropicalAffineReconstruction.lean`, proving finite-presentation extensionality and reconstruction lemmas using `Finset`/`Fintype` pointwise minima. Likely useful patterns: define tropical operations on presentations, prove `eval_insert`, `eval_union`, `eval_singleton`, and an extensional

# Algebraic–EML Tannaka Reconstruction via Closure Endomorphism Monoids

This file formalizes a reconstruction principle: a finitary closure operator on a
set is completely determined by its closed-set lattice, and hence by any
data (such as an endomorphism monoid) that determines that lattice. This bridges:
- **Algebraic lattice theory** / closure operators
- **Semiring and endomorphism algebra**
- **EML / Lawvere-style fixed-point semantics**
- **Post-quantum lattice cryptography** (separator hardness)

## Main results

* `closure_subset_closed_of_subset` — closed sets absorb closures of subsets
* `compactClosed_closed` — compact-closed sets are closed
* `algebraicLike_finite_witness` — finitary closures have finite witnesses
* `closure_eq_sInf_closed_eq` — closure = infimum of closed supersets
* `reconstructsClosure_empty` — reconstruction from closed sets (empty monoid)
* `closure_eq_of_sameClosedSets` — **Tannaka uniqueness**: closures with
  the same closed-set lattice must be equal
* `closure_eq_of_endMonoid_eq` — endomorphism monoid + separator → equal closures
* `closure_pointwise_quantum_reconstruction` — pointwise membership corollary
* `lipschitz_certified_robustness_identity` — identity is 1-Lipschitz on set distance
* `post_quantum_lattice_separator_bound` — finite separator orbit bound

## References

Inspired by Tannakian reconstruction in representation theory, adapted to
closure dynamics in the spirit of Lawvere's fixed-point semantics.

### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v7 Depth Requirements — Structured Proofs with Completeness Gates

You are producing Lean 4 code on the mathematical frontier. Your output must
be COMPILABLE and your proofs must be COMPLETE. A single correct proof of a
non-trivial result is worth more than 5 theorems with `sorry`.

### STEP 1: THEOREM DECLARATIONS (required — before any code)

List every theorem you intend to prove. For each, state:
- **Name**: The Lean declaration name
- **Statement**: One-sentence informal statement
- **Status**: `proved` | `conjecture` | `proved_with_lemma_sorry`
- **Why non-trivial**: One sentence on the key mathematical insight

Example:
1. `cantorPairing_surjective`: Cantor pairing is surjective — proved — constructive inverse
2. `cantorPairing_injective`: Cantor pairing is injective — proved — diagonal argument
3. `cantorPairing_bijection`: Cantor pairing is a bijection — proved_with_lemma_sorry — follows from 1+2

### STEP 2: PROVE THEOREMS (completeness gate)

Every theorem declared as `proved` MUST have a complete, compiling Lean proof.
No `sorry` on the main result. If you cannot complete a proof, change its status
to `conjecture` or `proved_with_lemma_sorry` and explain why.

For `proved_with_lemma_sorry`:
- The theorem statement must be complete (no sorry in the statement)
- `sorry` is allowed ONLY in supporting lemmas, never the main proof
- A comment must explain what the sorry replaces and why it's deferred

For your BEST theorem, also provide:
- A generalization or strengthening (can use sorry if proving would take too long)
- A boundary case or counterexample showing where the result fails

### STEP 3: Anti-patterns (reject these)

These tactics indicate trivial proofs:
- `native_decide` / `decide` / `norm_num` / `rfl` — unless genuinely proving a numeric fact
- `simp only []` with no simp set specified
- `sorry` on any theorem declared as `proved`

`omega`, `linarith`, and `Aesop` are fine for supporting lemmas.
`sorry` is fine for conjectures and generalizations.

### STEP 4: Novelty

Your theorems must be genuinely new. If a statement appears in a textbook,
generalize it. If you cannot formalize a concept rigorously, pick a different topic.

### Output format

Your output must include:
1. `.lean` files with the proofs (structured as declared in Step 1)
2. `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` with 3-5 research conjectures extending the work

Both are required. Missing FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md = automatic quality penalty.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
