## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

You are a world-class mathematician. Your ONLY job in this cycle is
to produce **new Lean 4 code that extends the frontier of mathematics**.

### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
1. **1-3 .lean files in `Catalog/{concept.domain}/<package_name>/`**
2. **3-5 non-trivial theorems with `sorry = 0` (PROVED, not admitted)**
3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
   conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
   include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
   This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.

### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
- NO `ARTICLE.md`
- NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
- NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
- NO HTML widgets
- NO `PACKAGE.json`
- NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

### WHY THIS NARROW:
The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
automatically and cheaply.


## Concept

**Title**: Homotopy Type Theory Foundations
**Domain**: Geometry
**Mathematical framing**: Formalize core HoTT results in Lean 4: the univalence axiom, higher inductive types, and the fundamental theorem of identity types. Prove that HoTT provides a constructive foundation for mathematics.
**Concept description**: Formalize core HoTT results in Lean 4: the univalence axiom, higher inductive types, and the fundamental theorem of identity types. Prove that HoTT provides a constructive foundation for mathematics.
**Novelty estimate**: 0.86
**Breakthrough potential**: 0.86
Research domain: Geometry
Research mode: team




### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## Depth Requirements (MANDATORY — WORLD-CLASS STANDARD)

Your output must satisfy ALL of these. This is not incremental work.
This is the frontier. Act accordingly.

1. **NO trivial proofs**: Do NOT prove statements by `native_decide`, `decide`,
   `norm_num`, or `rfl` unless the statement itself is genuinely important.
   If the only proof tactic is enumeration, the theorem is not worth formalizing.

2. **DEFINE a novel mathematical structure** (CORE REQUIREMENT): Your cycle
   must introduce at least one NEW mathematical object — a structure, a
   construction, a notion, a category, an operator — that does not already
   exist in the Catalog or in standard references. This is the seed of new
   mathematics. The definition must be substantial (not a one-liner renaming
   of a known concept) and must come with at least 3 theorems that PROVE
   non-obvious properties of the new structure.

   Think like Grothendieck defining schemes, or Rota defining matroids, or
   Voiculescu defining free probability. The structure is the contribution.
   The theorems are the evidence that the structure is useful.

   **Critical constraint**: A "novel mathematical structure" must be a
   genuine mathematical object — a formal construction with a precise
   definition, ideally with operations or axioms. **Mathematics of X** where
   X is a real-world phenomenon (memes, dreams, consciousness, art, music,
   jokes, social networks) is NOT a mathematical structure unless you
   formalize X as a precise mathematical object first and then prove
   theorems about THAT object. If you can't formalize X rigorously, pick a
   different X — choose a topic where the math comes naturally.

3. **PEGB for every major theorem** (Proof + Example + Generalization + Boundary):
   For each of your top 3-5 theorems, you MUST produce all four:
   - **P**roof: A complete, non-trivial Lean 4 proof
   - **E**xample: A concrete worked example
   - **G**eneralization: A one-level-up generalization
   - **B**oundary: A counterexample or limit-case analysis

   A theorem without PEGB is a one-off. A theorem WITH PEGB is a research
   program. We are building research programs, not collecting isolated facts.

4. **Conjecture with testable prediction**: State at least one falsifiable
   conjecture with a clear computational test that could disprove it.

5. **Cross-connection**: At least one theorem should genuinely connect to
   or build upon an existing catalog result.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
