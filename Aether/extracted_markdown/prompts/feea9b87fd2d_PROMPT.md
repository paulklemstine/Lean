            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are leading a research team: Hypothesizer, Experimenter, Analyst,
Critic, and Synthesist. Run the loop:
Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate.
Your ONLY job is to produce **new Lean 4 code** and **take good notes**
for the next team.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by theorem declarations)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.
5. **Lab Notebook** as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` comment blocks
   in each .lean file: Hypothesis, Result, Insight, Failure analysis.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Berggren Tree Geodesic Structure and Lorentz Lattice Reduction
**Domain**: Cryptography
**Mathematical framing**: Define the Berggren monoid B = ⟨A, B, C⟩ ⊂ GL(3,ℤ) where A, B, C are the three Berggren matrices already formalized. Define the word metric d_B(g, h) = min{n : g = h·w₁·...·wₙ, wᵢ ∈ {A,B,C}} on B. The Lorentz lattice is L = (ℤ³, Q) where Q(x) = x₁² + x₂² - x₃². The light cone is Λ₀ = {v ∈ ℤ³ : Q(v) = 0, v > 0 componentwise}. Theorem 1 (Geodesic Spanning): For every v ∈ Λ₀ primitive, there exists a unique word w ∈ {A,B,C}* such that w·(3,4,5) = v, and |w| = d_B(I, w). Theorem 2 (Lorentz Reduction): A vector v ∈ Λ₀ is Berggren-reduced iff its Berggren path from (3,4,5) is lexicographically minimal among all O(2,1;ℤ)-equivalent representations. Theorem 3 (Enumeration Complexity): The Berggren tree traversal visits primitive triples in near-order of their Euclidean norm, with |v|_₂ growing as O(√n) for the n-th triple, matching the growth rate of the Stern-Brocot tree.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that the Berggren tree of Pythagorean triples is not merely a generative device—it is a geodesic spanning tree of the primitive null vectors of the Lorentz form Q(x,y,z) = x² + y² - z² under the Berggren group action. Every primitive Pythagorean triple is reached by exactly one path from the root (3,4,5), and this path is length-minimizing with respect to the word metric on the Berggren monoid ⟨A,B,C⟩ ⊂ O(2,1;ℤ). This makes the Berggren tree the Lorentzian analogue of the Stern-Brocot tree for SL(2,ℤ), connecting Pythagorean number theory to lattice reduction in indefinite quadratic forms. Why now: The Berggren generators (berggrenMatA, berggrenMatB, berggrenMatC) and the Lorentz form (lorentzForm, lorentzQ, IsPythag) are already formalized in Cryptography/BerggrenLatticeCryptography.lean and Algebra/BerggrenLorentz/Core.lean. The geodesic property and the connection to lattice shortest-vector problems on indefinite forms has not been explored. This bridges Cryptography (lattice hardness), Pythagorean (Berggren trees), and Geometry (indefinite quadratic forms).
**Novelty estimate**: 0.78
**Breakthrough potential**: 0.68
Research domain: Cryptography
Research mode: prove

# Berggren Lattice Cryptography

## Bridge: Hyperbolic Geometry ⟶ Lattice Cryptography ⟶ Post-Quantum Security

This module develops the mathematical foundations connecting the Berggren tree of
primitive Pythagorean triples to lattice-based cryptographic structures. The key
insight is that the Berggren matrices live in O⁺(2,1; ℤ), the integral orthogonal
group of the Lorentz form Q(a,b,c) = a² + b² - c², and this group's action
on ℤ³ produces lattice structures with cryptographically relevant hardness properties.

### Main Results

1. **Lorentz Preservation**: Each Berggren matrix M satisfies MᵀQM = Q where
   Q = diag(1,1,-1) is the Lorentz form.
2. **Light Cone Classification**: Pythagorean triples lie exactly on the
   integer light cone {v ∈ ℤ³ : Q(v) = 0}.
3. **Berggren Group Structure**: The Berggren matrices generate a non-abelian
   subgroup of O(2,1; ℤ), with explicit determinant and trace bounds.
4. **Lattice SVP Bounds**: The shortest vector in Berggren-generated lattices
   satisfies explicit lower bounds tied to the Pythagorean structure.
5. **Key Exchange Foundations**: A matrix-path protocol with provable correctness.
6. **Lipschitz Bound**: Universal norm expansion bound ‖Mv‖² ≤ 35·‖v‖².

### Cross-Domain Connections

- **Number Theory → Cryptography**: Pythagorean triples generate lattices.
- **Hyperbolic Geometry → Post-Quantum Security**: The Lorentz group O(2,1)
  defines lattices resistant to quantum attacks.
- **Algebraic Number Theory → Key Exchange**: The Brahmagupta-Fibonacci
  identity (Gaussian integer norm multiplicativity) connects factoring to SVP.
- **Tropical Geometry → Certified Robustness**: The tropical light cone
  provides margin bounds for tropical neural network classifiers.

# Berggren-Tree Lattice Reduction and Shortest-Word Rigidity

## Overview

We formalize prefix-rigidity theorems for the positive Berggren semigroup
acting on primitive Pythagorean triples. The Berggren tree is viewed as a
**noncommutative geometric code**: words whose images are close must share structure.

## Word convention

A word `[g₁, g₂, ..., gₙ]` evaluates as `g₁(g₂(...(gₙ(root))...))`.
The **suffix** of a word (tail end) represents generators applied first (near root).
The **prefix** (head) represents the outermost generators.
Extending a tree path deeper means **prepending** to the word.

## Main Results

* `evalWord_append` — prefix factorization of evaluation
* `height_lower_bound_length` — height grows linearly with word length
* `evalAtRoot_injective` — evaluation is injective (freeness)
* `first_letter_divergence` — distinct first letters ⟹ positive distance
* `prefix_rigidity_exact` — geoDist = 0 ⟺ same word
* `candidateWordSet_finite` — candidate sets are finite
* `prune_prepend_sound` — sound branch-and-bound pruning
* `finite_nearby_words` — finite ambiguity at bounded distance

# Berggren Fingerprint Rigidity: Geodesic Length Fingerprints and Collision-Resistant Key Extraction

## Overview

We prove that the truncated "fingerprint" — the set of transformed triple data over a
bounded set of primitive Pythagorean triples — determines the abelianized generator profile
of a Berggren word. This establishes a rigidity theorem for the positive Berggren semigroup:
the action on even a single primitive triple carries enough information to distinguish words
up to abelianization.

## Mathematical Setup

The Berggren tree generates all primitive Pythagorean triples from the root (3,4,5) using
three 3×3 integer matrix generators U, A, D. A *word* `w : List (Fin 3)` represents a
sequence of generator applications. The *abelianized profile* `abelianCount w` records
how many times each generator appears, discarding order.

The key insight is that the three generators produce **pairwise distinct** full triples
when applied to any positive Pythagorean triple. Combined with the freeness of the Berggren
semigroup (proved herein), this gives a complete fingerprint rigidity result.

## Main Results

* `berggren_gen_hyp_increases` — each generator strictly increases hypotenuse
* `berggren_word_action_injective` — freeness of the Berggren semigroup
* `gen_hyp_pairwise_distinct` — distinct generators produce distinct hypotenuses
* `evalWord_append` — word evaluation is a homomorphism
* `abelianCount_append` — abelianized counts are additive
* `fingerprint_root_determines_word` — fingerprint over root determines the word
* `fingerprint_injective_abelianized` — fingerprint equality implies equal abelian counts
* `fingerprintSeparates_distinct_abelianizations` — collision obstruction
* `compareFingerprint_sound` — certified computable collision detection
* `exists_certified_radius` — explicit radius R₀ = 5 suffices

# Berggren-Lorentz Monoid: Discrete Lorentz Symmetry of Pythagorean Triples

This file develops the theory of the **Berggren monoid** — the three-generator
submonoid of GL₃(ℤ) that acts on primitive Pythagorean triples via the
Berggren tree. We establish:

1. All three generators preserve the Lorentzian quadratic form Q(a,b,c) = a²+b²-c²,
   placing them in the integer orthogonal group O(2,1;ℤ).
2. Determinant computations showing orientation structure (two proper, one improper).
3. Pythagorean preservation: children of Pythagorean triples are Pythagorean.
4. Hypotenuse growth bounds giving O(log c) tree depth.
5. Trace structure, inverse matrices, and non-commutativity of generators.
6. Quadratic form identities and bilinear form theory.

## Bridge: Number Theory (Pythagorean triples) ↔ Physics (Lorentz group O(2,1;ℤ))
↔ Cryptography (monoid action hardness) ↔ ML (Lipschitz bounds via matrix norms)

# Quantum Walk on the Berggren Tree: Algebraic and Spectral Foundations

This module formalizes the algebraic infrastructure for quantum walks on the Berggren
tree of primitive Pythagorean triples. The Berggren tree is the infinite ternary tree
rooted at (3,4,5) with branching given by three integer matrices A, B, C ∈ O(2,1;ℤ).

## Main results

### Pillar I: Lorentzian Matrix Algebra
- Berggren matrices preserve the Minkowski quadratic form x² + y² - z²
- Determinant structure: det(A) = det(C) = 1, det(B) = -1
- Trace computations and spectral moment analysis
- Complete inverse relations and tree well-foundedness

### Pillar II: Tree Combinatorics
- Level cardinality: exactly 3^d vertices at depth d
- Total cardinality: (3^{d+1} - 1)/2 vertices through depth d
- Quantum search step count bounds

### Pillar III: Quantum Walk Framework
- Novel typeclasses: `LorentzPreserver`, `QuantumWalkConfig`, `SpectralFilterConfig`
- Pell equation connection via B-branch hypotenuse recurrence
- Spectral divisibility filter framework

## Cross-domain bridges
- **Number theory ↔ Lorentzian geometry**: Berggren matrices in O(2,1;ℤ)
- **Quantum computing ↔ Diophantine equations**: walk operators on arithmetic trees
- **Spectral theory ↔ Pell equations**: eigenvalue phases in quadratic fields

## v8 Depth Requirements -- Research Team Protocol

You are leading a research team. Your team has different roles:
- The **Hypothesizer** generates bold, falsifiable conjectures
- The **Experimenter** proves or disproves them in Lean 4
- The **Analyst** examines what survived, what failed, and WHY
- The **Critic** searches for weaknesses, constructs counterexamples,
  and identifies where proofs might break down. A well-constructed
  counterexample is as valuable as a proof.
- The **Synthesist** upgrades the knowledge base and writes the
  FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md that seeds the next cycle

You run this loop: **Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate**.
Each cycle is not a one-shot task. It is one iteration of an infinite
research process. Your notes (FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md, Lab Notebooks,
proof sketches) determine whether the next team builds on your work
or starts over.

**Take good notes.** A cycle without useful notes is a wasted cycle.

### STEP 1: THEOREM DECLARATIONS (required -- before any code)

List every theorem you intend to prove or investigate. For each, state:
- **Name**: The Lean declaration name
- **Statement**: One-sentence informal statement
- **Status**: `hypothesis` | `conjecture` | `proved` | `proved_with_lemma_sorry` | `disproved`
- **Why it matters**: One sentence on what this result would mean if true,
  and what it would teach us if false

Example:
1. `cantorPairing_surjective`: Cantor pairing is surjective -- proved -- constructive inverse -- confirms decidability of Nat x Nat
2. `cantorPairing_injective`: Cantor pairing is injective -- proved -- diagonal argument -- confirms invertibility
3. `cantorPairing_bijection`: Cantor pairing is a bijection -- proved_with_lemma_sorry -- follows from 1+2 -- completing the characterization

Use `hypothesis` for statements you are not yet sure you can prove but
want to investigate. Use `conjecture` for statements you believe are true
but cannot prove in this cycle. Use `disproved` for statements where you
found a counterexample. Use `proved` for statements with complete Lean
proofs. Use `proved_with_lemma_sorry` when the main proof is complete but
one or more supporting lemmas use `sorry`.

### STEP 2: EXPERIMENT (prove or disprove in Lean 4)

Every theorem declared as `proved` MUST have a complete, compiling Lean proof.
No `sorry` on the main result. If you cannot complete a proof, change its
status to `conjecture` or `proved_with_lemma_sorry` and explain why.

For `proved_with_lemma_sorry`:
- The theorem statement must be complete (no sorry in the statement)
- `sorry` is allowed ONLY in supporting lemmas, never the main proof
- A comment must explain what the sorry replaces and why it is deferred

**Disproofs count.** If a hypothesis is false, prove its negation or
construct an explicit counterexample. A well-constructed counterexample
is as valuable as a proof. Change the status to `disproved` and state
the counterexample clearly.

### STEP 3: CRITIQUE (find the weaknesses)

For your best theorem, the Critic must:
- Identify the strongest assumption that could be weakened
- Construct a boundary case: where does the result break down?
- If possible, state a `conjecture` for the generalized version and
  explain what would need to change in the proof

This is NOT optional. A theorem without a critique is incomplete.

### STEP 4: Anti-patterns (reject these)

These tactics indicate trivial proofs:
- `native_decide` / `decide` / `norm_num` / `rfl` -- unless genuinely proving a numeric fact
- `simp only []` with no simp set specified
- `sorry` on any theorem declared as `proved`

`omega`, `linarith`, and `Aesop` are fine for supporting lemmas.
`sorry` is fine for conjectures, generalizations, and boundary cases.

### STEP 5: Novelty

Your theorems must be genuinely new. If a statement appears in a textbook,
generalize it. If you cannot formalize a concept rigorously, pick a different topic.

### STEP 6: TAKE GOOD NOTES (first-class deliverables)

Your notes determine what the next research team investigates. They are NOT
an afterthought. They are your most important output after the proofs themselves.

**6a. Lab Notebook** (in each .lean file, as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` blocks):

For each major theorem, include a Lab Notebook comment block:
```lean
-- !-- Lab Notebook: cantorPairing_bijection -- !--
-- !-- Hypothesis: Cantor pairing is bijective because both surjective and injective -- !--
-- !-- Result: Proved via composition of surjective and injective proofs -- !--
-- !-- Insight: The constructive inverse of surjectivity is key; diagonal argument handles injectivity -- !--
-- !-- Failure analysis: Initial attempt to prove bijection directly failed; decomposition into surjective+injective was necessary -- !--
-- !-- End Lab Notebook -- !--
```

**6b. FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** (MANDATORY — your output WILL BE REJECTED if missing):

You MUST produce a FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file with this EXACT structure.
Copy the section headers below verbatim. Do NOT use freeform prose.

## Synthesis

[2-3 paragraphs: what did this cycle discover? What failed and why? What
structural insight emerged? Tie the directions together into a narrative.]

## Results Summary

[For EACH theorem: name, status (proved/conjecture/disproved), one-sentence
significance. Format as a bullet list:]

- `theoremName`: status — one-sentence significance

## Research Directions

### Direction 1: [Concise title]
**Hypothesis**: A precise, falsifiable mathematical statement.
**Test**: What experiment (proof/disproof/computation) would confirm or refute it.
**Why now**: What from THIS cycle makes this tractable.
**If true**: What new territory this opens.
**If false**: What the failure teaches us.

[Repeat for 3-5 directions]

IMPORTANT: The ## Synthesis and ## Results Summary sections are NOT optional.
If your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is missing either section, it will be treated as
incomplete and the next research team will have no context to build on your work.

### STEP 7: Generalization loop

For your BEST theorem, attempt one level of generalization:
- State a stronger version (can use sorry if proving would take too long)
- Identify the boundary: where does the result break down?
- If the generalization is itself interesting, mark it as a `conjecture`
  in your theorem declarations and explain it in FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md

### Output format

Your output must include:
1. `.lean` files with proofs and Lab Notebook blocks (structured as declared in Step 1)
2. `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` with Synthesis, Results Summary, and 3-5 research
   directions (structured as in Step 6b)

Both are required. A cycle with proofs but no Lab Notebook or
FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is a cycle where the next team starts from scratch.
Take good notes.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
