            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are a world-class mathematician. Your ONLY job in this cycle is
to produce **new Lean 4 code that extends the frontier of mathematics**.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by the Plan)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Closure potential descent bounds for information-efficient reconstruction
**Domain**: Bridges
**Mathematical framing**: Work in a finite type of states with a set-closure operator `cl`. Define a reconstruction state space carrying a potential `Φ : State → ℕ` or more generally an ordered commutative monoid value, using `ClosurePotential` from the thermodynamic formalism. Let a probe family be closure-stable in the sense of `ClosureStableProbe`, and define an update operator `step` that either leaves a closed state fixed or applies a probe detecting failure of closedness. Main conjectural theorem package: (1) Potential monotonicity: `Φ (step s) ≤ Φ s`. (2) Strict descent off fixed points: if `s` is not closed / not reconstructed, then `Φ (step s) < Φ s`. (3) Termination bound: iterating `step` reaches a fixed point in at most `Φ s` steps when `Φ` is nat-valued. (4) Correctness: fixed points of `step` coincide with closure-fixed reconstructed states. (5) Packaging theorem: the resulting process instantiates `InfoEfficientAlgorithm`, so one obtains a certified algorithm with a machine-checkable resource bound via `terminates_within_potential`. This is falsifiable: strict descent may fail without additional assumptions, so part of the research is to identify the minimal hypotheses (e.g. probe progress, antisymmetry of the closure order, finite-height closure lattice) under which the theorem is true.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that the thermodynamic-style closure potential already present in the Algebra–EML bridge can be turned into a quantitative descent certificate for reconstruction algorithms: each closure-stable probe step should decrease a discrete potential by a controlled amount, yielding a provable termination bound and an explicit reconstruction pipeline rather than a mere existence theorem. Why now: the catalog already contains the three ingredients in mature form—closure systems and reconstruction operators in `Bridges/AlgebraEMLReconstruction.lean`, closure-stable probes in `Bridges/AlgebraEMLClosureComputation.lean`, and potential-based formalism in `Bridges/AlgebraicEMLThermodynamicFormalism.lean`, together with generic algorithmic termination interfaces in `Computation/InfoEfficientAlgorithms.lean`. The proposed direction is to prove a bridge theorem of the following shape: for a finite closure system equipped with a closure potential and a probe family satisfying closure-stability, any iterative reconstruction process that at each step applies a probe witnessing non-closedness strictly decreases the potential until it reaches a fixed point, hence terminates within at most `Φ(s₀)` steps. A stronger target is an exact correspondence between fixed points of the induced semimodule system and closed reconstructed states, plus a complexity bound showing that the number of oracle/probe calls is bounded by the initial potential. This would create a reusable algorithmic schema connecting abstract closure theory, thermodynamic monotonicity, and certified computation, and it is meaningfully different from the in-flight closure projects because it focuses on descent/termination theorems and complexity guarantees rather than reconstruction dualities or closure semimodule fixed-point formulations alone.
**Novelty estimate**: 0.88
**Breakthrough potential**: 0.9
Research domain: Bridges
Research mode: prove


### Lean 4 Sketch
Define an iterative update on top of `SetClosureOperator`/`ClosureStableProbe`; prove lemmas `potential_mono_step`, `potential_strict_of_not_closed`, `iterate_step_terminates_within`; instantiate `InfoEfficientAlgorithm` using the potential as measure; then prove `fixedPoint_iff_closed` and a final reconstruction correctness theorem.

# Algebraic–EML Tannaka Reconstruction via Closure Endomorphism Monoids

This file formalizes a reconstruction principle: a finitary closure operator on a
set is completely determined by its closed-set lattice, and hence by any
data (such as an endomorphism monoid) that determines that lattice. This bridges:
- **Algebraic lattice theory** / closure operators
- **Semiring and endomorphism algebra**
- **EML / Lawvere-style fixed-point semantics**
- **Post-quantum lattice cryptography** (separator hardness)

## Main results

* `closure_subset_closed_of_subset` — closed sets absorb closures of subsets
* `compactClosed_closed` — compact-closed sets are closed
* `algebraicLike_finite_witness` — finitary closures have finite witnesses
* `closure_eq_sInf_closed_eq` — closure = infimum of closed supersets
* `reconstructsClosure_empty` — reconstruction from closed sets (empty monoid)
* `closure_eq_of_sameClosedSets` — **Tannaka uniqueness**: closures with
  the same closed-set lattice must be equal
* `closure_eq_of_endMonoid_eq` — endomorphism monoid + separator → equal closures
* `closure_pointwise_quantum_reconstruction` — pointwise membership corollary
* `lipschitz_certified_robustness_identity` — identity is 1-Lipschitz on set distance
* `post_quantum_lattice_separator_bound` — finite separator orbit bound

## References

Inspired by Tannakian reconstruction in representation theory, adapted to
closure dynamics in the spirit of Lawvere's fixed-point semantics.

# Information-Efficient Algorithms: A Unified Theory

This file develops a unified mathematical framework showing that three canonical
algorithms—binary search, Dijkstra's shortest paths, and NTT/FFT—are instances
of a single paradigm: **information-efficient computation**.

## Novel Definitions

- `InfoEfficientAlgorithm`: A certified algorithm with quantitative termination
  and correctness guarantees via invariant preservation and potential descent.

## Main Results

### Binary Search
- `binarySearch_correct`: Binary search finds the least satisfying index.
- `binarySearch_invariant_preserved`: Loop invariant preservation.
- `binarySearch_pow2_bound`: At most k steps for 2^k elements.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- `dijkstra_init_settled_optimal`: Initial state satisfies optimality.
- `dijkstra_global_correct`: Upon termination, all distances are optimal.

### NTT/FFT
- `NTT_convolution`: NTT diagonalizes cyclic convolution.
- `ntt_cost_recurrence`: The divide-and-conquer complexity bound.

### Cross-Domain Connections
- `binarySearch_entropy_certificate`: Binary search → entropy bound.
- `binarySearch_entropy_exact_pow2`: Powers of 2 have exact log entropy.
- `exists_principal_root_prime`: Number theory → NTT root existence.

### Conjecture
- `conjecture_binarySearch_trace_optimal`: Binary search is comparison-optimal.

/-! ## Part 1: The InfoEfficientAlgorithm Structure (Novel Definition) -/

/-- An information-efficient algorithm is a state machine equipped with:
- An initialization function from inputs to states
- A step function advancing computation
- A termination predicate
- An output extraction function
- An invariant relating input to state
- A potential function (natural number) that strictly decreases on each step

Together these certify both correctness and complexity. The potential
provides the complexity bound: at most `potential(init x)` steps are needed.

Dijkstra (monotone relaxation), and FFT (symmetry factorization)

# EML Closure Unification: Ideal-Theoretic Instances, Galois Fixed-Point Duality,
  and Noetherian Closure Certification

This file establishes the foundational trinity connecting EML (Extensive-Monotone-
Idempotent) closure operators to algebraic closure operators:

1. **EML-Ideal Mirror**: Ideal/submodule generation is an EML closure operator, and
   every Mathlib `ClosureOperator` satisfies the EML axioms.
2. **Galois Fixed-Point Mirror**: Every Galois connection induces dual EML
   closure/kernel operators whose fixed-point sets are order-isomorphic.
3. **Noetherian Closure Certification**: Noetherian ↔ ascending chain stabilization,
   providing certified ideal membership testing.

No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v7 Depth Requirements — Structured Proofs with Completeness Gates

You are producing Lean 4 code on the mathematical frontier. Your output must
be COMPILABLE and your proofs must be COMPLETE. A single correct proof of a
non-trivial result is worth more than 5 theorems with `sorry`.

### STEP 1: THEOREM DECLARATIONS (required — before any code)

List every theorem you intend to prove. For each, state:
- **Name**: The Lean declaration name
- **Statement**: One-sentence informal statement
- **Status**: `proved` | `conjecture` | `proved_with_lemma_sorry`
- **Why non-trivial**: One sentence on the key mathematical insight

Example:
1. `cantorPairing_surjective`: Cantor pairing is surjective — proved — constructive inverse
2. `cantorPairing_injective`: Cantor pairing is injective — proved — diagonal argument
3. `cantorPairing_bijection`: Cantor pairing is a bijection — proved_with_lemma_sorry — follows from 1+2

### STEP 2: PROVE THEOREMS (completeness gate)

Every theorem declared as `proved` MUST have a complete, compiling Lean proof.
No `sorry` on the main result. If you cannot complete a proof, change its status
to `conjecture` or `proved_with_lemma_sorry` and explain why.

For `proved_with_lemma_sorry`:
- The theorem statement must be complete (no sorry in the statement)
- `sorry` is allowed ONLY in supporting lemmas, never the main proof
- A comment must explain what the sorry replaces and why it's deferred

For your BEST theorem, also provide:
- A generalization or strengthening (can use sorry if proving would take too long)
- A boundary case or counterexample showing where the result fails

### STEP 3: Anti-patterns (reject these)

These tactics indicate trivial proofs:
- `native_decide` / `decide` / `norm_num` / `rfl` — unless genuinely proving a numeric fact
- `simp only []` with no simp set specified
- `sorry` on any theorem declared as `proved`

`omega`, `linarith`, and `Aesop` are fine for supporting lemmas.
`sorry` is fine for conjectures and generalizations.

### STEP 4: Novelty

Your theorems must be genuinely new. If a statement appears in a textbook,
generalize it. If you cannot formalize a concept rigorously, pick a different topic.

### Output format

Your output must include:
1. `.lean` files with the proofs (structured as declared in Step 1)
2. `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` with 3-5 research conjectures extending the work

Both are required. Missing FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md = automatic quality penalty.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
