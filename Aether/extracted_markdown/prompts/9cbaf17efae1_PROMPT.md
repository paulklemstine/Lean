            # Phase A Research Mission v16: Functorial tropical valuation profiles from finite combinatorial species coefficients

            ## Concept
            **Domain**: Bridges
            **Research mode**: formalize
            **Title**: Functorial tropical valuation profiles from finite combinatorial species coefficients
            **Description**: The key insight is that the coefficient extraction machinery behind combinatorial species can be turned into a genuinely new tropical valuation object by sending each truncation level n to the order-theoretic profile of vanishing and support of the first n exponential generating function coefficients, and proving that species sum and product induce max-plus/min-plus style inequalities on these profiles rather than merely classical coefficient identities. Why now: `Applications/CombinatorialSpecies.lean` already isolates the core algebra of `binConv`, `egf_add`, and `egf_mul`, while `Bridges/CategoricalTropicalUltrametric.lean` provides a ready-made target notion of tropical valuation object; this makes it tractable to build a cross-domain bridge that is not a repetition of the recent Rips or p-adic valuation pipelines. The concrete objective is to define, for finitely supported or coefficientwise decidable species-generating data, a tropical profile recording the least index of nonzero coefficient and the threshold counts of nonvanishing coefficients up to degree n, then prove: (1) additivity/monotonicity under species sum using `egf_add`; (2) convolution-controlled subadditivity under species product using `binConv` and `egf_mul`; (3) a functorial map from a small category of finite species expressions into `TropicalValuationObject`; and ideally (4) a stability theorem showing coefficient support inclusion induces order preservation of the tropical profile. This would create a new Applications↔Bridges bridge from enumerative combinatorics to tropical semantics, produce an algorithmic pipeline for extracting tropical invariants from finite species expressions, and open falsifiable follow-ups about recognizability, growth, and classification by tropical support signatures rather than raw generating functions.

# Combinatorial Species as Functors and the Exponential Generating Function Bridge

This file formalizes a fragment of Joyal's theory of **combinatorial species** and the
classical bridge to **analytic functors / exponential generating functions (EGF)**.

A species is modeled (in skeletal form) as a functor from the *groupoid of finite sets*
to finite sets: a family `obj : ℕ → Type` of finite "structure types", together with a
functorial action of the symmetric group `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` (relabelling) on each
`obj n`.  Its EGF is the formal power series

  `EGF F = ∑ₙ (|F[n]| / n!) Xⁿ`.

The central enumerative-combinatorics ↔ analysis dictionary established here is:

* **sum of species ↔ sum of EGFs**            (`egf_add`)
* **product of species ↔ product of EGFs**    (`egf_mul`, `egf_card_prodSpecies`)
* **species of sets `E` ↔ `exp`**             (`EGF_setSpecies`)
* **species of linear orders `L` ↔ 1/(1-X)**  (`egf_linearOrderSpecies`)

The product law is the heart of the bridge: the *structural* product of species (the
Day-convolution `(F·G)[n] = Σ_{S ⊆ [n]} F[S] × G[n∖S]`) has cardinality the **binomial
convolution** of the counting sequences, which is exactly the Cauchy product of the EGFs.

## Main results
* `egf_add`              — additivity of the EGF.
* `egf_mul`              — binomial convolution of counting sequences ↔ product of EGFs.
* `EGF_setSpecies`       — EGF of the species of sets equals `PowerSeries.exp ℚ`.
* `egf_linearOrderSpecies` — `(1 - X) · EGF(L) = 1`, i.e. EGF of linear orders is `1/(1-X)`.
* `card_prodSpecies`     — cardinality of the structural product is the binomial convolution.
* `egf_card_prodSpecies` — the full bridge: EGF of the structural product = product of EGFs.

### Deepening — the differential calculus of species (this cycle)
* `egf_injective`         — the EGF transform is injective on counting sequences.
* `binConv_comm`          — commutativity of the species product, via the analytic shadow.
* `egf_derivative`        — shift of a sequence ↔ formal derivative `derivativeFun`.
* `egf_pointing`          — multiplication by the index ↔ Euler operator `X·d/dX`.
* `EGF_derivativeSpecies` — `(F′).EGF = (F.EGF).derivativeFun` for the derivative species `F′`.
* `EGF_pointedSpecies`    — `(F•).EGF = X · (F.EGF).derivativeFun` for the pointed species `F•`.

  # Categorical Tropical–Ultrametric Equivalence
  ## via Valuation Reconstruction and Functorial Bound Transfer

  Bridge: connects tropical algebra ↔ ultrametric analysis ↔ certified robustness ↔
  post-quantum lattice-style metrics.

  **Core principle**: tropical valuation data on an ordered idempotent semiring can be
  reconstructed into an ultrametric seminorm, and quantitative bounds proven in the
  tropical world transfer functorially to ultrametric certified bounds relevant to
  quantum/cryptographic/ML settings.

  The most important mathematical message: **valuation reconstruction is not just a
  dictionary — it is a quantitative functor**.

### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


            ## v16 Research Core Methodology — Scientific Team Loop

You are the Principal Investigator leading a research team with four
roles: **Hypothesizer**, **Experimenter**, **Analyst**, and **Critic**.
Run the following loop and record notes at each stage.

### Stage 1 — Hypothesize (team: Hypothesizer)
Brainstorm 5–7 falsifiable conjectures about the topic. At least two
must be surprising or counter-intuitive. Rank them by expected
scientific impact, not by ease of proof.

### Stage 2 — Experiment (team: Experimenter)
For each conjecture, attempt to prove it in Lean 4 or disprove it with
a concrete counterexample. Prioritize the most surprising conjectures
first. If a proof is beyond reach, prove the strongest lemma you can
and mark the remaining step with exactly one `sorry` that is clearly
documented.

### Stage 3 — Analyze (team: Analyst)
Summarize what survived, what failed, and **why** failures failed.
Distinguish "true but hard", "false", and "needs a different
definition". These insights are as valuable as the proofs.

### Stage 4 — Critique / Adversarial Review (team: Critic)
Before finalizing, challenge every theorem:
- Is any theorem trivial (True, definitional equality, `native_decide`)?
- Does every main theorem have 0 sorries?
- Do the results genuinely extend the attached catalog files?
- Are there hidden assumptions or corner cases that break the claim?
If you find a weakness, fix it or replace the theorem with a guarded
version and explain the boundary.

### Stage 5 — Synthesize (team: Principal Investigator)
Combine the verified results into clean, compiling Lean 4 files.
Write a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` that lists 3–5 **bold, testable**
conjectures derived from Stage 3 and Stage 4. Each conjecture must
include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?"
justification.

### Perpetual Scientific Iteration (do not stop at first synthesis)
When the research team comes together with results, do not stop. Treat the synthesized findings as the next problem statement and immediately run the full scientific-method loop again: hypothesize, experiment, review, synthesize, critique. Repeat this cycle continuously within the available context window, refining, deepening, and cross-checking until forced to emit output. Use Aristotle to its fullest.


            ### Anti-Trivial Guardrails (non-negotiable)
The following are NOT acceptable as main results:
- Theorems of the form `theorem name {X : Type*} [Inhabited X] : True := by trivial`.
- Definition-only theorems or definitional equalities proved by `rfl`.
- Results whose entire proof is `simp`, `norm_num`, `decide`, or `native_decide`.
- Wrapper types that rename existing definitions.
- Re-proving existing catalog theorems with minor notation changes.

Every main theorem must use at least one insight-bearing tactic or
technique such as `induction`, `by_contra`, `field_simp`, `ring_nf`,
`omega`, `linarith`, `rcases`, or a custom helper lemma.


            ### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
1. **Lean 4 files** (2–4 files in the appropriate `Catalog/<domain>/` subtree).
   - Main theorems must be fully proved (0 sorries).
   - Each file must contain `-- !-- Lab Notes -- !--` blocks documenting
     the team loop: Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis, Critique, Synthesis.
2. **FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** with 3–5 bold, falsifiable conjectures derived
   from the cycle's findings. Each must have a "The key insight is..."
   sentence and a "Why now?" justification.

### Strictly Forbidden in Phase A
- `ARTICLE.md`, `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`, `demo.py`, HTML widgets, `PACKAGE.json`.
- Prose for human readers other than Lab Notes and FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md.


            ## Self-Critique Checklist (perform before final output)
            Review your candidate output and answer each item. If the answer is
            unsatisfactory, revise the output before returning it.

            - [ ] No theorem is trivial (True, Inhabited-only, native_decide-only, etc.).
            - [ ] Every main theorem has 0 sorries.
            - [ ] At least one theorem imports or uses results from the attached catalog.
            - [ ] Lab Notes blocks contain real hypotheses, results, insights, and failure analysis.
            - [ ] FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md conjectures are derived from this cycle's findings.
            - [ ] Every future direction includes a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.

            ## Output Format Reminder
            Return `.lean` files and `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` only. Focus all compute
            on the mathematics.
