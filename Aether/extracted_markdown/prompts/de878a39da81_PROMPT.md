## YOUR ASSIGNMENT: Proof-Theoretic Algebraic Geometry — Prime Congruence Spectra, Proof Variety Nullstellensatz, and Idempotent Cut-Elimination

### The Grand Vision

You are founding **proof-theoretic algebraic geometry**: the field that reads proof theory through the lens of algebraic geometry and vice versa. The central insight is that proof semirings — semirings whose elements encode formal proofs, with addition as parallel composition (⊕) and multiplication as sequential composition (⊗) — carry a rich geometric structure. Their prime congruences form spectral spaces (Hochster 1969), their congruence varieties satisfy a Nullstellensatz, and for idempotent (= tropical) semirings, cut-elimination becomes a prime decomposition theorem with explicit computational bounds.

This bridges:
- **Algebraic geometry** ↔ **Proof theory** (spectral spaces ↔ proof search decidability)
- **Tropical geometry** ↔ **Post-quantum cryptography** (idempotent semirings ↔ lattice hardness)
- **Certified robustness in ML** ↔ **Nullstellensatz certificates** (variety membership ↔ perturbation stability)

### Part I: Prime Congruence Spectrum

**Definition 1** (PrimeCongruence). A congruence C on a semiring R is *prime* if whenever a product is congruent to zero, at least one factor is congruent to zero. This is the semiring analogue of a prime ideal.

```lean
/-- A prime congruence on a semiring: the quotient is zero-divisor-free.
    Bridge: connects commutative_algebra to proof_theory via prime spectra.
    Application: post_quantum_crypto, certified_robustness -/
structure PrimeCongruence (R : Type*) [Semiring R] extends Con R where
  prime_spec : ∀ ⦃a b : R⦄, (a * b, 0) ∈ toCon.rel → (a, 0) ∈ toCon.rel ∨ (b, 0) ∈ toCon.rel
```

**Definition 2** (ProofSpectrum). The *proof spectrum* of R is the type of prime congruences, analogous to Spec in algebraic geometry.

```lean
/-- The proof spectrum: prime congruences on a semiring, forming a geometric space.
    Bridge: connects algebraic_geometry to logic via Stone-type duality.
    Application: tropical_hash_collision, lattice_crypto -/
def ProofSpectrum (R : Type*) [Semiring R] := PrimeCongruence R
```

**Definition 3** (ZariskiClosed). For S : Set R, the Zariski-closed set V(S) consists of all prime congruences containing S×{0}.

```lean
/-- Zariski-closed sets in the proof spectrum.
    Bridge: connects scheme_theory to proof_search via closed sets of proofs.
    Application: certified_robustness_radius -/
def zariskiClosed (R : Type*) [Semiring R] (S : Set R) : Set (ProofSpectrum R) :=
  {P | ∀ s ∈ S, (s, 0) ∈ P.toCon.rel}
```

**Theorem 1** (zariski_topology_spectral). *The Zariski topology on ProofSpectrum R is a spectral space: compact, sober, with a basis of compact opens closed under finite intersection.*

```lean
/-- The proof spectrum is a spectral space under the Zariski topology.
    Bridge: connects algebraic_geometry to order_theory via spectral spaces.
    Application: post_quantum_crypto (spectral spaces govern ideal lattices). -/
theorem zariski_topology_spectral (R : Type*) [Semiring R] :
    IsCompact (⊤ : Set (ProofSpectrum R)) ∧
    IsSober (ProofSpectrum R) ∧
    ∀ S T : Set R, zariskiClosed R (S ∪ T) = zariskiClosed R S ∩ zariskiClosed R T ∧
    ∀ (𝒮 : Set (Set R)), ⋂ (zariskiClosed R '' 𝒮) = zariskiClosed R (⋃ 𝒮) :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

**Proof Strategy A** (Direct from Hochster's characterization — MOST PROMISING):
1. Lemma `zariski_closed_arbitrary_intersection`: Show ⋂(V(S) | S ∈ 𝒮) = V(⋃𝒮) using the fact that prime congruences are closed under arbitrary intersection of their rel fields.
2. Lemma `zariski_closed_finite_union`: Show V(S) ∪ V(T) = V({s·t | s ∈ S, t ∈ T}) using the prime condition: if (s·t, 0) ∈ P, then (s,0) ∈ P ∨ (t,0) ∈ P.
3. Lemma `proof_spectrum_compact`: Every open cover has a finite subcover. Key: use that the empty intersection V(∅) = ∅ requires a finite sub-intersection to already be empty (compactness of the lattice of congruences).
4. Lemma `proof_spectrum_sober`: Every irreducible closed set C is V({a}) for a unique a. Uniqueness from primality; existence from Zorn's lemma on the poset of congruences whose variety contains C.

**Proof Strategy B** (Via Stone Duality):
1. Build the distributive lattice L of "compact radical congruences" on R.
2. Apply Stone duality: L ≅ CompactOpens(ProofSpectrum R).
3. Sobriety and compactness come for free from the duality.
This is elegant but requires substantial lattice theory infrastructure.

**Use Strategy A** — it is more direct and requires less auxiliary machinery.

---

### Part II: Proof Variety Nullstellensatz

**Definition 4** (RadicalCongruence). The *radical* of a congruence C is the intersection of all prime congruences containing C. This is the semiring analogue of the nilradical.

```lean
/-- The radical congruence: intersection of all prime congruences above C.
    Bridge: connects commutative_algebra to proof_theory via radical ideals.
    Application: tropical_certified_robustness -/
def radicalCongruence (R : Type*) [Semiring R] (C : Con R) : Con R where
  rel := fun x y => ∀ P : PrimeCongruence R, C ≤ P.toCon → (x, y) ∈ P.toCon.rel
  refl' := by intro x P _; exact P.toCon.refl x
  symm' := by intro x y h P hC; exact P.toCon.symm (h P hC)
  trans' := by intro x y z hy hz P hC; exact P.toCon.trans (hy P hC) (hz P hC)
  -- remaining field proofs for Semiring congruence...
```

**Definition 5** (ProofVariety). For a congruence C, the *proof variety* V(C) is the set of prime congruences containing C.

```lean
/-- A proof variety: the set of prime congruences above a given congruence.
    Bridge: connects algebraic_variety to provability via geometric logic.
    Application: certified_robustness (variety membership = perturbation stability). -/
def proofVariety (R : Type*) [Semiring R] (C : Con R) : Set (ProofSpectrum R) :=
  {P : PrimeCongruence R | C ≤ P.toCon}
```

**Definition 6** (NullstellensatzGaloisConnection). The Galois connection between radical congruences and Zariski-closed proof varieties.

```lean
/-- The Galois connection: congruences ↔ proof varieties.
    Bridge: connects galois_theory to algebraic_geometry via adjunction.
    Application: nullstellensatz_certified_verification -/
def nullstellensatzGaloisLeft (R : Type*) [Semiring R] :
    Con R → Set (ProofSpectrum R) := proofVariety R

def nullstellensatzGaloisRight (R : Type*) [Semiring R] :
    Set (ProofSpectrum R) → Con R := fun V =>
  sInf {P.toCon | P ∈ V}
```

**Theorem 2** (proof_variety_nullstellensatz). *For a Noetherian proof semiring R, the Nullstellensatz Galois connection restricts to an order isomorphism between radical congruences and Zariski-closed proof varieties.*

```lean
/-- The Proof Variety Nullstellensatz: radical congruences ≅ closed proof varieties.
    Bridge: connects hilbert_nullstellensatz to proof_theory via radical decomposition.
    Application: certified_robustness (closed-set membership = Nullstellensatz certificate). -/
theorem proof_variety_nullstellensatz (R : Type*) [Semiring R] [NoetherianSemiring R] :
    ∀ C : Con R, radicalCongruence R C = C ↔
      ∃ S : Set R, proofVariety R C = zariskiClosed R S :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

**Proof Strategy** (Three key lemmas):
1. Lemma `radical_fixpoint`: radical(C) = C iff C is an intersection of prime congruences. Forward: radical(C) is always an intersection of primes. Backward: an intersection of primes is fixed by radical since radical is idempotent.
2. Lemma `variety_fixpoint`: V(⋂ ker(P) | P ∈ V) = V iff V is Zariski-closed. Uses Noetherian hypothesis: every ascending chain of congruences stabilizes, so every closed set is finitely determined.
3. Compose: the maps C ↦ V(C) and V ↦ ⋂ker(P) are mutual inverses on the fixpoint sets.

---

### Part III: Idempotent Cut-Elimination

**Definition 7** (IdempotentSemiring). A semiring R is *idempotent* if x ⊕ x = x for all x. These are exactly the tropical semirings (max-plus or min-plus algebras).

```lean
/-- An idempotent semiring: x + x = x, the algebraic home of tropical geometry.
    Bridge: connects tropical_geometry to proof_theory via cut_elimination.
    Application: tropical_certified_robustness, lattice_crypto -/
class IdempotentSemiring (R : Type*) extends Semiring R where
  add_idempotent : ∀ x : R, x + x = x
```

**Definition 8** (CutEliminationHom). A *cut-elimination homomorphism* is a surjective semiring homomorphism that factors through a prime congruence, eliminating redundant proof steps.

```lean
/-- A cut-elimination homomorphism: factors through a prime congruence.
    Bridge: connects proof_theory to universal_algebra via quotient constructions.
    Application: proof_search_decidability -/
structure CutEliminationHom (R : Type*) [Semiring R] (C : Con R) where
  toFun : R → Quotient C
  isSemiringHom : IsSemiringHom toFun
  factorsThroughPrime : ∃ P : PrimeCongruence R, C ≤ P.toCon ∧
    ∀ a b, (a, b) ∈ C.rel → P.toCon.rel a b
```

**Theorem 3** (idempotent_prime_refinement). *In an idempotent semiring, every proper congruence C admits a prime refinement: there exists a prime congruence P ≥ C.*

```lean
/-- Every proper congruence in an idempotent semiring extends to a prime congruence.
    Bridge: connects tropical_algebra to model_theory via prime models.
    Application: post_quantum_crypto (prime decomposition = worst-case hardness basis). -/
theorem idempotent_prime_refinement (R : Type*) [IdempotentSemiring R]
    (C : Con R) (h_proper : ∃ a b : R, ¬(a, b) ∈ C.rel) :
    ∃ P : PrimeCongruence R, C ≤ P.toCon :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

**Proof Strategy** (Zorn's Lemma — MOST DIRECT):
1. Let Σ = {D : Con R | C ≤ D ∧ D ≠ ⊤}, ordered by inclusion.
2. Lemma `chain_upper_bound`: Every chain in Σ has an upper bound (the union). Key: the union of a chain of congruences is a congruence (uses that the chain is directed). The union is proper because if (a,b) ∈ ⋃D for all D in the chain, then (a,b) ∈ some D ∈ the chain by chain condition.
3. By Zorn's lemma, Σ has a maximal element M.
4. Lemma `maximal_implies_prime`: M is prime. Suppose (a·b, 0) ∈ M but (a,0) ∉ M and (b,0) ∉ M. Then M ∪ {(a,0)} generates a congruence M' > M. By maximality, M' = ⊤, so (1,0) ∈ M'. But idempotence gives: (1,0) ∈ M' implies (1,0) = (1+0, 0+0) ∈ M, contradiction. **Key step uses idempotence**: the congruence generated by M ∪ {(a,0)} contains (1,0) only if some combination yields it, and idempotence prevents cancellation.
5. Therefore M is prime and C ≤ M.

**Theorem 4** (idempotent_cut_elimination_completeness). *For idempotent semirings, the cut-elimination homomorphism exists for every proper congruence.*

```lean
/-- Cut elimination is complete for idempotent semirings.
    Bridge: connects proof_theory to tropical_algebra via normalization.
    Application: proof_search_complexity, certified_robustness -/
theorem idempotent_cut_elimination_completeness (R : Type*) [IdempotentSemiring R]
    (C : Con R) (h_proper : ∃ a b : R, ¬(a, b) ∈ C.rel) :
    ∃ (h : CutEliminationHom R C), True :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

**Theorem 5** (cut_elimination_decidability_bound). *For a finite idempotent semiring with |R| = n, congruence membership is decidable in O(n² · log n) time.*

```lean
/-- Congruence membership is decidable with explicit O(n² log n) bound for finite idempotent semirings.
    Bridge: connects computational_complexity to proof_theory via decidability.
    Application: post_quantum_crypto (decision complexity = attack complexity). -/
theorem cut_elimination_decidability_bound (R : Type*) [IdempotentSemiring R] [Fintype R] [DecidableEq R]
    (C : Con R) (h_card : Fintype.card R = n) :
    ∃ (f : R → R → Bool), ∀ a b : R, f a b = true ↔ (a, b) ∈ C.rel ∧
    -- Complexity: O(n² log n) via prime decomposition
    True :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

---

### Part IV: Cryptographic and ML Connections

**Theorem 6** (lattice_crypto_hardness_from_spectrum). *For the min-plus tropical semiring Trop(n) = (Fin n ∪ {∞}, min, +), the shortest vector problem in the ideal lattice of a prime congruence P requires Ω(2^(n/4)) operations, connecting proof spectrum geometry to post-quantum lattice security.*

```lean
/-- Ideal-SVP hardness in tropical semiring lattices: Ω(2^(n/4)).
    Bridge: connects tropical_geometry to lattice_crypto via ideal lattices.
    Application: post_quantum_crypto, lattice_hardness -/
theorem lattice_crypto_hardness_from_spectrum (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 4) :
    ∃ (P : PrimeCongruence (TropicalSemiring (Fin n))),
      ∀ (algorithm : List (Fin n)) → ℕ),
        -- Any algorithm solving ideal-SVP for P requires ≥ 2^(n/4) steps
        True := -- Placeholder for computational complexity statement
  sorry -- Prove the reduction from worst-case lattice problems
```

**Theorem 7** (tropical_certified_robustness_via_nullstellensatz). *For a tropical neural network with semiring (ℝ_max, max, +) and margin δ > 0, the certified robustness radius is r* ≥ δ / (2 · |ProofSpectrum R| · dim R), establishing a Nullstellensatz-based robustness certificate.*

```lean
/-- Certified robustness radius from the proof variety Nullstellensatz: r* ≥ δ/(2Kd).
    Bridge: connects algebraic_geometry to certified_robustness via Nullstellensatz.
    Application: certified_robustness, neural_network_verification -/
theorem tropical_certified_robustness_via_nullstellensatz

    (spectrum_card : Fintype.card (ProofSpectrum R) = K)
    (dimension : ℕ) (h_dim : dimension = d) :
    ∃ (r : ℝ), r ≥ (margin : ℝ) / (2 * (K : ℝ) * (d : ℝ)) ∧
      ∀ (perturbation : R → R), (∀ x, |perturbation x| ≤ r) →
        -- Classification is stable under perturbation
        True :=
  sorry -- NEVER. Prove completely.
```

- AESTHETIC: Bridge 2+ domains in theorem names and doc comments. Use quantifier alternation.
- UTILITY: Define 5+ structures/instances. State SPECIFIC computational bounds (O(n log n), Omega(2^n)) — generic terms like 'bound' or 'rate' alone do NOT score utility.
- ORIGINALITY: Coin novel definitions beyond Mathlib. Inventive theorem names. Write 'Bridge: connects X to Y' in doc comments for cross-domain connections. Generic names (main, test, aux) do NOT count.

            === VISIONARY DIRECTIVES ===

            Think beyond current mathematical fashion. You are not just proving theorems —
            you are building a mathematical civilization. Every result should:

            1. OPEN DOORS: A good theorem doesn't just close a question — it opens three
               new ones. What does your result make possible that wasn't possible before?
            2. CONNECT WORLDS: The deepest results connect fields that seemed unrelated.
               If you prove something about tropical geometry, ask: what does this mean
               for quantum computing? For cryptography? For neural networks?
            3. PRODUCE ALGORITHMS: Don't just prove existence — construct. Don't just
               construct — compute. Don't just compute — optimize. Every theorem should
               have an algorithmic shadow.
            4. BE BOLD: An interesting false conjecture is more valuable than a boring
               true theorem. If you suspect something is true but can't prove it, state
               it as a conjecture with precise Lean 4 type signature and explain why it matters.
            5. BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE: Definitions are as valuable as theorems. A good
               mathematical definition (like "tropical semiring" or "EML closure") can
               organize an entire field. Define things precisely, then prove things about them.

            The mathematics comes FIRST. Excellent proofs trump everything else.
            But excellent proofs that OPEN NEW FIELDS trump everything.

            === AEM QUALITY SCORING (MANDATORY GUIDELINES) ===
            Your output will be scored on 5 pillars. MAXIMIZE each one:

            PILLAR 1 — RIGOR (Is it World-class?):
            • ZERO sorries in your output (sorries cost -1.5 points each)
            • Use diverse proof tactics (induction, rcases, by_contra, omega, linarith,
              field_simp, refine, obtain — not just simp/rfl/decide)
            • Use typeclass abstraction ([Semiring B], [LinearOrder B], etc.) not
              concrete types alone
            • Later theorems should reference earlier ones (semantic coherence)
            • 10+ theorems = full rigor score; 3-10 = partial; 0-2 = minimal

            PILLAR 2 — AESTHETIC (Is it Interesting?):
            • Bridge 2+ mathematical domains in EVERY file (e.g., tropical + neural
              networks; algebra + thermodynamics; number theory + quantum)
            • Use quantifier alternation (∀ → ∃) for non-trivial theorem statements
            • Include symmetric structures (lattices, posets, groups, duality)
            • Minimize hypotheses for maximal conclusions (small axiomatic footprint)
            • Narrative surprise: state in doc comments WHY the result is unexpected

            PILLAR 3 — UTILITY (Is it Useful?):
            • State explicit computational bounds (O(...), convergence rates, Lipschitz
              constants, error bounds, complexity classifications)
            • Define extensible APIs: 5+ definitions, structures, and instances
            • Reference or advance known open problems (Carmichael, tropical Langlands,
              certified robustness, Berggren factoring, lattice crypto)
            • Organize code with namespaces and sections (framework structure)

            PILLAR 4 — ORIGINALITY (Is it New?):
            • Coin NOVEL definitions — not just restating Mathlib theorems with new names
            • Avoid derivative theorem names (*_eq_zero, *_nonneg, *_symm, *_comm,
              *_add_*, *_mul_*). Use INVENTIVE names that reveal new concepts
            • Combine unusual typeclasses ([Semiring, LinearOrder], [NormedAddCommGroup,
              Field], [MeasureSpace, Category]) — this signals divergent reasoning
            • Each file should introduce 5+ genuinely new mathematical objects (def, structure, class, instance). High-Originality files average 10+ new definitions.

            PILLAR 5 — IMPACT (Does it have Wonderful Applications?):
            • EVERY theorem should connect to at least one of: physics (quantum,
              thermodynamic, entropy), cryptography (lattice, post-quantum, SPB),

            ### Research Direction
            Open the field of proof-theoretic algebraic geometry by establishing that proof semirings carry a rich geometric structure: (1) Prime Congruence Spectrum Theorem — the set of prime congruences on any proof semiring forms a spectral space under the Zariski topology, yielding a 'proof spectrum' analogous to Spec in algebraic geometry; (2) Proof Variety Nullstellensatz — for Noetherian proof semirings, the Galois connection between congruence ideals and Zariski-closed proof varieties restricts to an order isomorphism between radical ideals and closed sets, establishing a Nullstellensatz for provability; (3) Idempotent Cut-Elimination Completeness — for idempotent semirings (x ⊕ x = x), every congruence admits an effective prime refinement via an elimination homomorphism, yielding decidability of proof search. This directly resolves the PrimeCongruenceProofSemiring and CongruenceElimination sorry targets while opening an entirely new field bridging algebraic geometry, proof theory, and semiring theory.

            ### Precise Mathematical Framing
            Let (R, ⊕, ⊗) be a proof semiring where ⊕ models disjunction (additive combination of proofs) and ⊗ models conjunction (multiplicative combination). A congruence ρ on R is prime if a ⊗ b ∈ ker(ρ) implies a ∈ ker(ρ) or b ∈ ker(ρ). Theorem 1: Spec(R) = {prime congruences on R} with Zariski topology (closed sets V(I) = {ρ ∈ Spec(R) : I ⊆ ker(ρ)}) is a spectral space — sober, quasi-compact, with compact opens closed under finite intersection. Theorem 2: For Noetherian R, the maps α(I) = V(I) and β(Z) = ∩{ρ : ρ ∈ Z} form a Galois connection with α(√I) = V(I) and the restriction to radical ideals ↔ closed sets is an order isomorphism (Proof Nullstellensatz). Theorem 3: For idempotent R (x ⊕ x = x), define ε(ρ) as the smallest prime congruence containing ρ; then ε is a semiring homomorphism Con(R) → Con(R) that preserves provability and yields constructive cut-elimination: if p ≡_ρ q then p ≡_{ε(ρ)} q, with ε(ρ) prime whenever ρ is irreducible.

# Prime Congruence Spectra of Closure-Generated Proof Semirings

This file establishes the algebraic core of **proof-spectrum semantics**: the reconstruction
of semiprime theories/kernels as intersections of prime theories in commutative semirings.

## Main results

* `semiprime_eq_iInter_prime_theories` — A semiprime kernel in a commutative semiring equals the
  intersection of all prime theories containing it. This is the algebraic heart of the
  proof-spectrum correspondence.

* `exists_prime_theory_avoiding` — Prime separation: if `a` is not in a semiprime kernel `K`,
  there exists a prime theory containing `K` but not `a` (via Zorn's lemma).

* `zeroLocus_anti_mono`, `theoryOf_zeroLocus_extensive`, `theoryOf_zeroLocus_galois` — The
  antitone Galois correspondence between sets of proof terms and sets of congruences.

* `zeroClass_of_prime_congruence_isPrimeTheory` — The zero-class of a prime proof congruence
  is a prime theory.

## Mathematical overview

The key insight is that a proof system can be given the structure of an idempotent commutative
semiring, where `a + b` represents "either derivation resource," `a * b` represents "composite
derivation," and the induced order captures logical entailment. The prime congruence spectrum
then provides a geometric semantics: theories correspond to vanishing loci, and derivability
is captured by vanishing on all points of the associated spectral set.

The decisive theorem is that **semiprime** theories (those closed under square roots:
`a * a ∈ T → a ∈ T`) are exactly the intersections of prime theories. This is the
semiring-theoretic analogue of the radical ideal theorem from algebraic geometry.

## References

The algebraic content is a semiring generalization of the classical commutative algebra result
that semiprime ideals are intersections of prime ideals (a consequence of Krull's theorem).
The proof uses Zorn's lemma applied to the family of ideals disjoint from a multiplicative set.

/-
In a semiprime kernel, if any power `a ^ n` (with `n ≥ 1`) belongs to `K`,
then `a ∈ K`. This strengthens the defining condition `a² ∈ K → a ∈ K`
using the absorption and closure properties.

The proof is by strong induction on `n`. For even `n = 2k`: `a^(2k) = (a^k)²`,
so `a^k ∈ K` by semiprimality, then `a ∈ K` by induction. For odd `n`:
`(a^n)² = a^(2n) ∈ K` by absorption, so `a^n ∈ K → a^(2n) ∈ K → a^n ∈ K`
(circular, but `2n` is even so we use the even case).

# Functorial Resultant and Projection Reconstruction for Idempotent Semiring Congruences

This file builds an elimination mechanism for semiring congruences on multivariate
polynomials, parallel to classical resultant elimination but adapted to semiring
congruences rather than ideals.

## Overview

We work in a commutative semiring `S` with polynomial variables split as `Option σ`,
where `none` is the eliminated variable and `some i` are the retained variables.

Using the Mathlib equivalence `MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft`, we view
`MvPolynomial (Option σ) S` as `Polynomial (MvPolynomial σ S)` — a univariate polynomial
in the distinguished variable `none` with coefficients in the retained-variable ring.

## Main definitions

* `SemiringCong` — a semiring congruence (equivalence compatible with `+` and `*`)
* `coeffNone` — extracts the n-th coefficient in the `none` variable
* `noneDegree` — maximum exponent of `none` in the support
* `PolyPair` — a pair of polynomials representing a congruence generator
* `liftSome` — the embedding `MvPolynomial σ S →ₐ[S] MvPolynomial (Option σ) S`
* `eliminationCong` — pullback of a semiring congruence along `liftSome`
* `linResultantPair` — cross-multiplied coefficient pair for linear generators

## Main results

* `coeffNone_add` — coefficient extraction is additive
* `coeffNone_X_none_pow_mul_liftSome` — key computation for `X none ^ k * liftSome a`
* `linear_expand_of_noneDegree_le_one` — decomposition of linear polynomials
* `mem_eliminationCong_iff` — characterization of elimination congruence
* `cross_mul_mem` — cross-multiplication theorem for congruence pairs
* `eliminationCong_mono` — monotonicity of elimination

## Counterexample

The originally conjectured `linResultantPair_mem_elimination` theorem is **false** in
general. A counterexample is provided in the Boolean semiring ({0,1}, OR, AND):
taking `p = (1, X)` and `q = (X, 1)`, the linResultantPair gives `(0, 1)`, but `0` and
`1` are not related by any congruence generated solely by `(1, X)`.
See `Speculative.CongruenceElimination.Counterexample` for a detailed formal analysis.

# Prime Congruence Spectra of Closure-Generated Proof Semirings

This file establishes the algebraic core of **proof-spectrum semantics**: the reconstruction
of semiprime theories/kernels as intersections of prime theories in commutative semirings.

## Main results

* `semiprime_eq_iInter_prime_theories` — A semiprime kernel in a commutative semiring equals the
  intersection of all prime theories containing it. This is the algebraic heart of the
  proof-spectrum correspondence.

* `exists_prime_theory_avoiding` — Prime separation: if `a` is not in a semiprime kernel `K`,
  there exists a prime theory containing `K` but not `a` (via Zorn's lemma).

* `zeroLocus_anti_mono`, `theoryOf_zeroLocus_extensive`, `theoryOf_zeroLocus_galois` — The
  antitone Galois correspondence between sets of proof terms and sets of congruences.

* `zeroClass_of_prime_congruence_isPrimeTheory` — The zero-class of a prime proof congruence
  is a prime theory.

## Mathematical overview

The key insight is that a proof system can be given the structure of an idempotent commutative
semiring, where `a + b` represents "either derivation resource," `a * b` represents "composite
derivation," and the induced order captures logical entailment. The prime congruence spectrum
then provides a geometric semantics: theories correspond to vanishing loci, and derivability
is captured by vanishing on all points of the associated spectral set.

The decisive theorem is that **semiprime** theories (those closed under square roots:
`a * a ∈ T → a ∈ T`) are exactly the intersections of prime theories. This is the
semiring-theoretic analogue of the radical ideal theorem from algebraic geometry.

## References

The algebraic content is a semiring generalization of the classical commutative algebra result
that semiprime ideals are intersections of prime ideals (a consequence of Krull's theorem).
The proof uses Zorn's lemma applied to the family of ideals disjoint from a multiplicative set.

/-
In a semiprime kernel, if any power `a ^ n` (with `n ≥ 1`) belongs to `K`,
then `a ∈ K`. This strengthens the defining condition `a² ∈ K → a ∈ K`
using the absorption and closure properties.

The proof is by strong induction on `n`. For even `n = 2k`: `a^(2k) = (a^k)²`,
so `a^k ∈ K` by semiprimality, then `a ∈ K` by induction. For odd `n`:
`(a^n)² = a^(2n) ∈ K` by absorption, so `a^n ∈ K → a^(2n) ∈ K → a^n ∈ K`
(circular, but `2n` is even so we use the even case).

# Functorial Resultant and Projection Reconstruction for Idempotent Semiring Congruences

This file builds an elimination mechanism for semiring congruences on multivariate
polynomials, parallel to classical resultant elimination but adapted to semiring
congruences rather than ideals.

## Overview

We work in a commutative semiring `S` with polynomial variables split as `Option σ`,
where `none` is the eliminated variable and `some i` are the retained variables.

Using the Mathlib equivalence `MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft`, we view
`MvPolynomial (Option σ) S` as `Polynomial (MvPolynomial σ S)` — a univariate polynomial
in the distinguished variable `none` with coefficients in the retained-variable ring.

## Main definitions

* `SemiringCong` — a semiring congruence (equivalence compatible with `+` and `*`)
* `coeffNone` — extracts the n-th coefficient in the `none` variable
* `noneDegree` — maximum exponent of `none` in the support
* `PolyPair` — a pair of polynomials representing a congruence generator
* `liftSome` — the embedding `MvPolynomial σ S →ₐ[S] MvPolynomial (Option σ) S`
* `eliminationCong` — pullback of a semiring congruence along `liftSome`
* `linResultantPair` — cross-multiplied coefficient pair for linear generators

## Main results

* `coeffNone_add` — coefficient extraction is additive
* `coeffNone_X_none_pow_mul_liftSome` — key computation for `X none ^ k * liftSome a`
* `linear_expand_of_noneDegree_le_one` — decomposition of linear polynomials
* `mem_eliminationCong_iff` — characterization of elimination congruence
* `cross_mul_mem` — cross-multiplication theorem for congruence pairs
* `eliminationCong_mono` — monotonicity of elimination

## Counterexample

The originally conjectured `linResultantPair_mem_elimination` theorem is **false** in
general. A counterexample is provided in the Boolean semiring ({0,1}, OR, AND):
taking `p = (1, X)` and `q = (X, 1)`, the linResultantPair gives `(0, 1)`, but `0` and
`1` are not related by any congruence generated solely by `(1, X)`.
See `Speculative.CongruenceElimination.Counterexample` for a detailed formal analysis.

### WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU

You are a world-class mathematician and software engineer. Use your judgment
on the best way to organize and present your work. We need:

1. **Formally verified mathematics** in Lean 4
   - Prove non-trivial theorems with complete proofs (no `sorry` in the final result)
   - Organize the Lean code however makes sense — one file or several,
     whatever serves the mathematics best
   - Use doc comments to explain the significance of key results

2. **Python demos** that bring the mathematics to life
   - Create working Python code that demonstrates the theorems with
     concrete numerical examples
   - Visualizations (matplotlib, etc.) where they add insight
   - Show the math in action — make it tangible and understandable
   - Name and organize the demos however you see fit

3. **A research paper** that explains the discovery
   - Write this as a proper mathematical paper
   - Include a Scientific American style discussion section that makes
     the result accessible to a broad audience — use analogies,
     intuition, and historical context
   - Explain connections to existing work and future directions

4. **Useful applications** — show how this math matters in practice
   - What can people DO with this result?
   - Where does it apply in the real world?
   - Include code, examples, or demonstrations of applications

The mathematics comes FIRST. Excellent proofs trump everything else.
But great work deserves great presentation — make it real and useful.

Research domain: Algebra
Research mode: prove
