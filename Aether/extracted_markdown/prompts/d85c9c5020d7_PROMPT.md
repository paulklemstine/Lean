## PHASE B: PACKAGING ONLY — COMMUNICATING THE MATH

Phase A of this cycle has already done the math. Lean 4 files have
been produced with 3-5 world-class theorems. Your ONLY job in
Phase B is to **package this work for human readers**.

### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
1. **ARTICLE.md** — Standalone popular-science article (1500-3000 words).
   Write about IDEAS, not formal verification. No mentions of Lean or
   proof assistants. Vivid prose, narrative arc, real-world connections.
   **Must be fully self-contained and publishable without any external
   references.** State every theorem, result, and definition inline —
   do NOT use @file references or point to other files. A reader with
   only this article must understand every result without looking elsewhere.
2. **RESEARCH_PAPER.md** — In-depth research paper (3000-8000 words).
   Abstract, definitions, main results (with proof sketches — NOT
   full Lean), algorithms, applications, discussion, future work.
   **Must be fully self-contained and publishable quality without any
   external references.** State every theorem, lemma, and definition
   inline with its full mathematical statement and proof sketch. Do NOT
   use @file references or reference other files. A reader with only this
   paper must be able to follow every result from start to finish.
3. **demo.py** — Numerical examples demonstrating the key results.
   Self-contained Python, type hints, all functions inlined.
4. **PACKAGE.json** — Single JSON bundling all of the above, with this schema:

```json

  "future_directions": "FUTURE_DIRECTIONS_CONTENT",
  "modules": {"demo": "# full demo.py source..."},
  "lean_files": ["Catalog/Domain/Package/File.lean"]
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The `demos`, `algorithms`, `visualizations`, and
`interactive_demos` fields MUST be arrays of objects with the
exact structure shown above. Do NOT use placeholder strings like
"MISSING" — either include real content or omit the field entirely.

### DO NOT OUTPUT:
- NO new `.lean` files
- NO new theorem proofs
- NO changes to the existing Lean 4 source
- NO `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` as a separate file (Phase A already produced
  future directions — they are provided below for inclusion in PACKAGE.json)

The math is already proved. Treat the Lean files below as the
ground truth — your prose should explain and contextualize them.
State theorems inline in your article and paper — they must be
self-contained and publishable without external references.

# The Hodge–Deligne E-polynomial as a Bridge to Arithmetic

This file introduces the two-variable **Hodge–Deligne E-polynomial**
`E(X; u, v) = Σ_{p,q} (-1)^{p+q} h^{p,q} uᵖ vᵍ`
on an abstract `HodgeDiamond` structure and proves two genuine *functional equations*:

* `epoly_serre_functional_equation` — the Serre/Poincaré duality equation
  `E(X; u, v) = (uv)ⁿ E(X; 1/u, 1/v)` (under Serre duality of `X`);
* `epoly_mirror_functional_equation` — the mirror equation
  `E(mirror X; u, v) = (-1)ⁿ uⁿ E(X; 1/u, v)` (unconditionally).

Specialising at `u = v = 1` recovers `eulerChar_mirror_sign`, the statement that the
topological Euler characteristic of the mirror diamond is `(-1)ⁿ` times the original.
We also record `totalDim_mirror` (the total Hodge dimension is mirror-invariant) and
upgrade the mirror involution to Calabi–Yau data (`CalabiYauData.mirror`).

This is a *duality / representation* bridge: it translates the geometric mirror
involution `(p,q) ↦ (n-p, q)` and Serre duality `(p,q) ↦ (n-p, n-q)` into algebraic
symmetries (functional equations) of a single polynomial invariant.

-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--
Hypothesis: The numerical mirror sign `χ(mirror X) = (-1)ⁿ χ(X)` is the `u=v=1`
  shadow of a polynomial-level functional equation in the Hodge–Deligne E-polynomial.
Result: Both the Serre/Poincaré and mirror functional equations are formalised over an
  arbitrary field `K`, and the numerical Euler-characteristic sign and total-dimension
  invariance are recovered as corollaries (the former literally by specialising the
  E-polynomial at `u = v = 1`, see `epoly_one_one_eq_eulerChar`).
Insight: Both geometric involutions are *reflections* `j ↦ n - j` on the index range,
  so `Finset.sum_range_reflect` is the single combinatorial engine behind all the
  functional equations; the `(-1)ⁿ` and `(uv)ⁿ` prefactors are exactly the bookkeeping
  of the parity shift `(-1)^{(n-p)+(n-q)} = (-1)^{2n}·(-1)^{p+q}` and the exponent shift
  `uⁿ · u⁻ᵖ = u^{n-p}`.
Failure analysis: Defining `h` on all of `ℕ × ℕ` (rather than `Fin (n+1)²`) means the
  mirror involution `mirror ∘ mirror = id` only holds on the support `p, q ≤ n`; we
  therefore state the involution at the level of the E-polynomial / pointwise on the
  support (`mirror_mirror_h`, `epoly_mirror_mirror`) rather than as a definitional
  equality of structures.

# Future Directions — Hodge–Laplacian Message Passing as a Discrete Heat Semigroup

## Synthesis

This cycle closed the conceptual loop opened by the spectral-depth-threshold work
(`Speculative.AutoResearch.HodgeSpectralThreshold`) and the convergence theory
(`Speculative.AutoResearch.HodgeMessagePassingConvergence`). Those two files
established that depth-`k` Hodge message passing `Tᵏ = (1 − α·Δ)ᵏ` fixes the
harmonic (cohomology) subspace and geometrically suppresses everything else. The
new file `Speculative.AutoResearch.HodgeHeatSemigroup` upgrades that picture from
*decay estimates* to the full **structure of a discrete heat semigroup generated
by the Hodge Laplacian**:

* a depth-additive **semigroup law** `Tᵐ⁺ⁿ = Tᵐ∘Tⁿ` (`mpStep_semigroup`);
* **commutation with the generator** `Δ∘Tᵏ = Tᵏ∘Δ` (`mpStep_commute`,
  `mpStep_iterate_commute`);
* the literal **discrete heat equation** `Tᵏ⁺¹x − Tᵏx = −α·Δ(Tᵏx)`
  (`mpStep_discrete_heat_equation`) — message passing *is* explicit-Euler heat flow
  with time step `α`;
* the exact **Dirichlet energy balance** `⟪x,x⟫ − ⟪Tx,Tx⟫ = α(2⟪x,Δx⟫ − α⟪Δx,Δx⟫)`
  (`mpStep_energy_dissipation`), its **monotone dissipation** under a stable step
  (`mpStep_energy_monotone`), and the **telescoping total-dissipation identity**
  (`mpStep_total_dissipation`); and
* the bridge `hodge_heat_stationary`: harmonic cochains are *exactly* the stationary
  solutions of the discrete heat flow, recovering the catalog's
  `HodgeSpectralThreshold.harmonic_iff` characterisation of cohomology.

A pleasant adversarial outcome: the energy-balance and telescope theorems were
first stated with a self-adjointness hypothesis `⟪Δx,y⟫ = ⟪x,Δy⟫`, but pressure-
testing revealed the cross terms collapse through `real_inner_comm` alone — so both
hold for an *arbitrary* operator `Δ`, and the hypothesis was dropped. Only the
*monotone* inequality genuinely needs a Rayleigh (spectral) bound, not symmetry.

## Results summary

All eight headline theorems in `HodgeHeatSemigroup.lean` are proved sorry-free and
depend only on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. The file imports and
builds directly on the two predecessor catalog files; no result is reproved.

## Research directions

### 1. The iterate converges in operator norm to the harmonic projector.
We proved that `‖Tᵏ(h+r) − h‖² ≤ ρᵏ‖r‖²`; the natural next theorem is that, on a
finite-dimensional cochain space, `Tᵏ → P`, the orthogonal projection onto
`ker Δ` (the harmonic/cohomology subspace already constructed in
`HodgeHarmonicProjector`). **The key insight is** that the semigroup law plus
monotone dissipation force every orbit to land on its harmonic part, so the limit
operator is idempotent, self-adjoint, and has range exactly `ker Δ` — i.e. it can
only be `P`. **Why now?** This cycle supplies the missing semigroup and dissipation
structure, and the catalog already contains a verified harmonic projector to
identify the limit with; the two just need to be glued by a finite-dimensional
```

## Your task

Produce the deliverables listed above. The Lean file is the source of truth —
your prose must accurately explain it. Both ARTICLE.md and RESEARCH_PAPER.md
MUST be self-contained and publishable without referencing any external files.
State every theorem, definition, and result inline so a reader can follow the
entire argument from the document alone.

ARTICLE.md: write a popular-science narrative that makes the key idea accessible.
RESEARCH_PAPER.md: write the formal paper with abstract, definitions, results.
demo.py: write numerical examples that demonstrate the results.
PACKAGE.json: bundle everything into a single JSON with ALL fields populated.
Make sure demos, algorithms, visualizations, and interactive_demos are arrays
of objects (not placeholder strings). For each algorithm in the algorithms array, provide a clear, professional mathematical title in 'name' (do not use generic placeholders; this will be displayed as the header on the interactive site), a detailed explanation of its logic and complexity in 'description', formal step-by-step pseudocode in 'pseudocode', and clean type-hinted Python code in 'code'. For each Python demo in the demos array, provide a highly descriptive title in 'name', a comprehensive functional description in 'description', and the implementation code in 'code'. For each interactive HTML demo in interactive_demos, provide a beautiful title in 'title' and a detailed description in 'description'. Include future directions from Phase A in the future_directions field.

Be vivid, be precise, be world-class. The math has already been done — now
make it beautiful to read.
