            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are leading a research team: Hypothesizer, Experimenter, Analyst,
Critic, and Synthesist. Run the loop:
Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate.
Your ONLY job is to produce **new Lean 4 code** and **take good notes**
for the next team.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by theorem declarations)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.
5. **Lab Notebook** as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` comment blocks
   in each .lean file: Hypothesis, Result, Insight, Failure analysis.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Langlands for Toddlers: Galois Groups as Shapes, Automorphic Forms as Colors
**Domain**: Pythagorean
**Mathematical framing**: The Langlands program connects Galois groups (shapes) to automorphic forms (colors). Think of it this way: a Galois group is the group of symmetries of a shape (like the rotational symmetries of a polygon). An automorphic form is a coloring that respects the shape's symmetries (like a coloring of the polygon's vertices that is invariant under rotation). The Langlands correspondence says: for every 'shape' (Galois representation), there is a matching 'color' (automorphic form) and vice versa. Conjecture: This correspondence is a bijection between irreducible representations of Gal(Q_bar/Q) and cuspidal automorphic representations of GL_n over Q. For n=1, this is class field theory (every abelian extension of Q corresponds to a Dirichlet character). For n=2, this is the modularity theorem (every elliptic curve over Q corresponds to a weight-2 cusp form). The toddler version: each shape has exactly one matching color, and each color has exactly one matching shape. Test: verify the correspondence for all degree-2 extensions of Q up to discriminant 1000. Verify that each quadratic field Q(sqrt(d)) corresponds to a Dirichlet character chi_d via the correspondence chi_d(p) = (d/p) (Legendre symbol). Impact: Langlands is just shape-color matching. Shapes and colors are two ways of seeing the same mathematical object.

### Lean 4 Sketch
State the Langlands correspondence for GL_2: there is a bijection between irreducible 2-dimensional Galois representations rho: Gal(Q_bar/Q) -> GL_2(C) and cuspidal automorphic representations of GL_2 over Q. For the toddler version: every quadratic field Q(sqrt(d)) corresponds to a Dirichlet character chi_d: (Z/DZ)* -> {±1} where D is the discriminant. Verify: for d = -1 (Q(i)), D = -4, chi_{-4}(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)/2} for odd n. For d = 2 (Q(sqrt(2))), D = 8, chi_8(n) = (-1)^{(n^2-1)/8}. For each 



### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v12 Depth Requirements -- Speculative Specifier Research Engine

You are leading a mathematical research team. Your goal is to produce groundbreaking,
master-class, useful, novel, and marvelous new Mathematics that pushes the frontier of human knowledge.

This engine is configured for **Speculative Specifying (Bold Conjectures)**. Target high-risk, high-reward, grand-challenge level research.

### RESEARCH CORE METHODOLOGY:
1. **Grand Challenges**: Formulate bold, surprising, and non-trivial conjectures that challenge existing intuition. Even if a complete proof cannot be achieved in this cycle, outline precise strategies, obstacles, and partial results.
2. **Deep Speculation**: Explore radical connections that seem distant or impossible at first glance. Frame your theorems as seeds for entirely new fields of study.
3. **Long-Term Roadmap**: Dedicate significant intellectual effort to detailing the proof strategies and testable predictions in your future directions, laying out a clear path for future researchers.

### DELIVERABLES:
- **Lean 4 proofs** of deep, non-trivial theorems with complete proofs (no sorry on main results).
- **Lab Notebook** comment blocks in each .lean file detailing Hypothesis, Result, Insight, and Failure analysis.
- **FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** outlining the Synthesis of your findings, a Results Summary, and 3-5 bold, falsifiable research directions to steer the next cycle.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
