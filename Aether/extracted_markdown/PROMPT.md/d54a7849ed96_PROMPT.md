            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are a world-class mathematician. Your ONLY job in this cycle is
to produce **new Lean 4 code that extends the frontier of mathematics**.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by the Plan)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Closure-stable probe reconstruction from valuation depth profiles
**Domain**: Bridges
**Mathematical framing**: Work in a finite `ClosureSemimoduleSystem` equipped with a finite `ProbeFamily`. Define a response functional `resp x p` valued in `ℕ` or `WithTop ℕ` by composing probe output with a valuation-depth measure modeled on `ValuationDepthMeasure`. Introduce a separation axiom: for any `x y` with distinct closures, there exists a closure-stable probe `p` such that `resp x p ≠ resp y p`. Main theorem targets: (1) `closure x = closure y → profile x = profile y`; (2) under separation, `profile x = profile y → closure x = closure y`; hence closure equivalence is decidable by finite profile comparison. A second theorem family should show monotonicity/subadditivity of profiles from `vdepth_sum_le`, giving algorithmic pruning lemmas for reconstruction. If the abstraction level is too high, specialize first to finitely supported semimodule elements or finite subsets under a `SetClosureOperator` from `Bridges/AlgebraEMLReconstruction.lean`, then lift. The likely proof pattern is: define profile, prove invariance under closure using `ClosureStableProbe`, prove converse from the separation hypothesis, then package a reconstruction certificate as an intersection over zero-response probe kernels.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that finite closure systems from the EML/algebra side can be interrogated by numerical probe families whose aggregated responses behave like valuation-depth invariants, yielding a concrete reconstruction theorem that bridges abstract closure operators with computational depth measures. Why now: the catalog already contains the exact ingredients on both sides — `Bridges/AlgebraEMLClosureComputation.lean` provides `ClosureSemimoduleSystem`, `ProbeFamily`, and `ClosureStableProbe`, while `Computation/PadicValuationDepth.lean` provides a ready-made subadditive depth functional (`ValuationDepthMeasure`, `vdepth_sum_le`) that can serve as the computational observable. The proposed direction is to define a finite probe-response profile of a closure object and prove a falsifiable theorem of the form: if two elements of a finite closure semimodule system have identical responses against every closure-stable probe in a separating family, then they have the same closure; conversely, under a suitable finite generation hypothesis, the closure of an element is recoverable as the intersection of all probe kernels whose valuation-depth response vanishes on that element. A stronger target is an algorithmic reconstruction pipeline: build a depth-profile map from elements to finitely supported functions on probes, prove it is monotone with respect to closure inclusion, prove injectivity modulo closure equivalence under a separation axiom, and derive a certificate theorem saying that equality of profiles certifies equality of closures. This is not a mere reformulation: it would create a new bridge between abstract closure theory and computable valuation-style invariants, with immediate relevance to catalog themes on reconstruction and computational extraction.

**Breakthrough potential**: 0.9

# Algebraic–EML Tannaka Reconstruction via Closure Endomorphism Monoids

This file formalizes a reconstruction principle: a finitary closure operator on a
set is completely determined by its closed-set lattice, and hence by any
data (such as an endomorphism monoid) that determines that lattice. This bridges:
- **Algebraic lattice theory** / closure operators
- **Semiring and endomorphism algebra**
- **EML / Lawvere-style fixed-point semantics**
- **Post-quantum lattice cryptography** (separator hardness)

## Main results

* `closure_subset_closed_of_subset` — closed sets absorb closures of subsets
* `compactClosed_closed` — compact-closed sets are closed
* `algebraicLike_finite_witness` — finitary closures have finite witnesses
* `closure_eq_sInf_closed_eq` — closure = infimum of closed supersets
* `reconstructsClosure_empty` — reconstruction from closed sets (empty monoid)
* `closure_eq_of_sameClosedSets` — **Tannaka uniqueness**: closures with
  the same closed-set lattice must be equal
* `closure_eq_of_endMonoid_eq` — endomorphism monoid + separator → equal closures
* `closure_pointwise_quantum_reconstruction` — pointwise membership corollary
* `lipschitz_certified_robustness_identity` — identity is 1-Lipschitz on set distance
* `post_quantum_lattice_separator_bound` — finite separator orbit bound

## References

Inspired by Tannakian reconstruction in representation theory, adapted to
closure dynamics in the spirit of Lawvere's fixed-point semantics.

# EML Closure Unification: Ideal-Theoretic Instances, Galois Fixed-Point Duality,
  and Noetherian Closure Certification

This file establishes the foundational trinity connecting EML (Extensive-Monotone-
Idempotent) closure operators to algebraic closure operators:

1. **EML-Ideal Mirror**: Ideal/submodule generation is an EML closure operator, and
   every Mathlib `ClosureOperator` satisfies the EML axioms.
2. **Galois Fixed-Point Mirror**: Every Galois connection induces dual EML
   closure/kernel operators whose fixed-point sets are order-isomorphic.
3. **Noetherian Closure Certification**: Noetherian ↔ ascending chain stabilization,
   providing certified ideal membership testing.

### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v7 Depth Requirements — Structured Proofs with Completeness Gates

You are producing Lean 4 code on the mathematical frontier. Your output must
be COMPILABLE and your proofs must be COMPLETE. A single correct proof of a
non-trivial result is worth more than 5 theorems with `sorry`.

### STEP 1: THEOREM DECLARATIONS (required — before any code)

List every theorem you intend to prove. For each, state:
- **Name**: The Lean declaration name
- **Statement**: One-sentence informal statement
- **Status**: `proved` | `conjecture` | `proved_with_lemma_sorry`
- **Why non-trivial**: One sentence on the key mathematical insight

Example:
1. `cantorPairing_surjective`: Cantor pairing is surjective — proved — constructive inverse
2. `cantorPairing_injective`: Cantor pairing is injective — proved — diagonal argument
3. `cantorPairing_bijection`: Cantor pairing is a bijection — proved_with_lemma_sorry — follows from 1+2

### STEP 2: PROVE THEOREMS (completeness gate)

Every theorem declared as `proved` MUST have a complete, compiling Lean proof.
No `sorry` on the main result. If you cannot complete a proof, change its status
to `conjecture` or `proved_with_lemma_sorry` and explain why.

For `proved_with_lemma_sorry`:
- The theorem statement must be complete (no sorry in the statement)
- `sorry` is allowed ONLY in supporting lemmas, never the main proof
- A comment must explain what the sorry replaces and why it's deferred

For your BEST theorem, also provide:
- A generalization or strengthening (can use sorry if proving would take too long)
- A boundary case or counterexample showing where the result fails

### STEP 3: Anti-patterns (reject these)

These tactics indicate trivial proofs:
- `native_decide` / `decide` / `norm_num` / `rfl` — unless genuinely proving a numeric fact
- `simp only []` with no simp set specified
- `sorry` on any theorem declared as `proved`

`omega`, `linarith`, and `Aesop` are fine for supporting lemmas.
`sorry` is fine for conjectures and generalizations.

### STEP 4: Novelty

Your theorems must be genuinely new. If a statement appears in a textbook,
generalize it. If you cannot formalize a concept rigorously, pick a different topic.

### Output format

Your output must include:
1. `.lean` files with the proofs (structured as declared in Step 1)
2. `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` with 3-5 research conjectures extending the work

Both are required. Missing FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md = automatic quality penalty.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
