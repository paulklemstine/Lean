            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are leading a research team: Hypothesizer, Experimenter, Analyst,
Critic, and Synthesist. Run the loop:
Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate.
Your ONLY job is to produce **new Lean 4 code** and **take good notes**
for the next team.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by theorem declarations)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.
5. **Lab Notebook** as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` comment blocks
   in each .lean file: Hypothesis, Result, Insight, Failure analysis.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of the Number 163
**Domain**: Cryptography
**Mathematical framing**: Ramanujan's constant e^{pi*sqrt(163)} is remarkably close to an integer: it equals 262537412640768743.99999999999925... — just 7.5 * 10^{-13} away from 262537412640768744. This is not a coincidence: 163 is the largest Heegner number, and the near-integer property follows from the j-function and the fact that Q(sqrt(-163)) has class number 1. But 163 appears EVERYWHERE: it is prime, it is the smallest p such that Q(sqrt(-p)) has class number 1 and p > 2, it is a Chen prime, a lucky prime, a strongly prime, and the 38th prime. Conjecture: 163 is the unique integer n such that e^{pi*sqrt(n)} is within 10^{-6} of an integer. More generally, the Heegner numbers (1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163) are exactly the n for which Q(sqrt(-n)) has class number 1, and e^{pi*sqrt(n)} is near-integer for each. The 'magic' of 163 is that it is the LAST Heegner number — the final class number 1 imaginary quadratic field. Test: prove that e^{pi*sqrt(n)} is within 10^{-6} of an integer only for Heegner numbers. Compute e^{pi*sqrt(67)} and e^{pi*sqrt(43)} and verify near-integer behavior. Prove that 163 is the largest Heegner number (Stark-Heegner theorem). Impact: 163 is not magic — it is the climax of a deep theorem in algebraic number theory. The near-integer property of e^{pi*sqrt(163)} is the shadow of the class number 1 condition.

### Lean 4 Sketch
State the Stark-Heegner theorem: the imaginary quadratic fields Q(sqrt(-d)) with class number 1 are exactly d = 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163. Prove e^{pi*sqrt(d)} is near-integer for each Heegner number: by the j-function expansion, j((1+sqrt(-d))/2) is an algebraic integer, and e^{pi*sqrt(d)} = (j/1728 + ... )^{1/3} * 12. For d = 163, j((1+sqrt(-163))/2) = -640320^3, so e^{pi*sqrt(163)} = 640320^3 + 744 - error. Prove uniqueness: for non-Heegner d, the class number h(-d) >= 2, so j((1+sqrt(-



### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v9 Depth Requirements -- Adversarial Ground-Truth Research Engine

You are leading a mathematical research team. Your goal is to produce groundbreaking,
master-class, useful, novel, and marvelous new Mathematics that pushes the frontier of human knowledge.

This engine is configured for **Adversarial Ground-Truth**. Trust nothing, assume everything is false until proven, and actively seek weaknesses. Think like an Adversarial Critic to pressure-test claims.

### RESEARCH CORE METHODOLOGY:
1. **Challenge Assumptions**: For every conjecture or theorem under investigation, actively search for counterexamples, corner cases, and boundary conditions. Proving that a claim is FALSE or identifying exactly where it fails is as valuable as a proof.
2. **Stress-Test the Frontier**: When a proof succeeds, push it to its limits. What happens if you drop or if a hypothesis is weakened? Write explicit comments documenting these boundary conditions.
3. **Relentless Rigor**: Write robust, clean, compilable Lean 4 proofs. Avoid trivial tautologies or simple wrapper theorems. Let your mathematical curiosity drive deep structural insights.

### DELIVERABLES:
- **Lean 4 proofs** of deep, non-trivial theorems with complete proofs (no sorry on main results).
- **Lab Notebook** comment blocks in each .lean file detailing Hypothesis, Result, Insight, and Failure analysis.
- **FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** outlining the Synthesis of your findings, a Results Summary, and 3-5 bold, falsifiable research directions to steer the next cycle.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
