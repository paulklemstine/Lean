            **Title**: Quantum Groups from Number Theory: The Riemann Hypothesis as a Representation Problem
            **Description**: The Riemann zeta function zeta(s) has non-trivial zeros at s = 1/2 + i*gamma_n on the critical line (assuming RH). These zeros encode deep arithmetic information. Conjecture: the zeros gamma_n are the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, and this operator is the Casimir element of a quantum group G_q. Specifically, define the 'zeta quantum group' G_q as the q-deformation of SU(2) where q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1} (using the first zero gamma_1 ~ 14.13). The Casimir element C_q of G_q has eigenvalues that are quadratic functions of the representation labels, and the spectrum of C_q is {n(n+1) : n in N}. Conjecture: the Riemann zeros gamma_n are related to the spectrum of C_q by gamma_n = f(spectrum(C_q)) for some function f. If f is linear, this would mean the zeros are evenly spaced, which is false (the zeros have Poisson-like spacings). If f is logarithmic, gamma_n ~ pi*n/log(n) which matches the average spacing. Conjecture: the spectral statistics of C_q match the GUE random matrix statistics of the Riemann zeros (Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture). Test: compute the spectrum of C_q for G_q with q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1} and compare the spectral statistics with the Riemann zeros. Impact: the Riemann hypothesis is a representation-theoretic statement about quantum groups.

### Recent Discoveries in Catalog
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


            ## v16 Research Core Methodology — Scientific Team Loop

You are the Principal Investigator leading a research team with four
roles: **Hypothesizer**, **Experimenter**, **Analyst**, and **Critic**.
Run the following loop and record notes at each stage.

### Stage 1 — Hypothesize (team: Hypothesizer)
Brainstorm 5–7 falsifiable conjectures about the topic. At least two
must be surprising or counter-intuitive. Rank them by expected
scientific impact, not by ease of proof.

### Stage 2 — Experiment (team: Experimenter)
For each conjecture, attempt to prove it in Lean 4 or disprove it with
a concrete counterexample. Prioritize the most surprising conjectures
first. If a proof is beyond reach, prove the strongest lemma you can
and mark the remaining step with exactly one `sorry` that is clearly
documented.

### Stage 3 — Analyze (team: Analyst)
Summarize what survived, what failed, and **why** failures failed.
Distinguish "true but hard", "false", and "needs a different
definition". These insights are as valuable as the proofs.

### Stage 4 — Critique / Adversarial Review (team: Critic)
Before finalizing, challenge every theorem:
- Is any theorem trivial (True, definitional equality, `native_decide`)?
- Does every main theorem have 0 sorries?
- Do the results genuinely extend the attached catalog files?
- Are there hidden assumptions or corner cases that break the claim?
If you find a weakness, fix it or replace the theorem with a guarded
version and explain the boundary.

### Stage 5 — Synthesize (team: Principal Investigator)
Combine the verified results into clean, compiling Lean 4 files.
Write a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` that lists 3–5 **bold, testable**
conjectures derived from Stage 3 and Stage 4. Each conjecture must
include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?"
justification.

### Perpetual Scientific Iteration (do not stop at first synthesis)
When the research team comes together with results, do not stop. Treat the synthesized findings as the next problem statement and immediately run the full scientific-method loop again: hypothesize, experiment, review, synthesize, critique. Repeat this cycle continuously within the available context window, refining, deepening, and cross-checking until forced to emit output. Use Aristotle to its fullest.

### Extra Bridge Mandate (v16b)
At least one main theorem must import definitions or results from two
different catalog domains and combine them non-trivially. The Lab
Notes block must explicitly name which files from each domain were
used and what new connection they create.


            ### Anti-Trivial Guardrails (non-negotiable)
The following are NOT acceptable as main results:
- Theorems of the form `theorem name {X : Type*} [Inhabited X] : True := by trivial`.
- Definition-only theorems or definitional equalities proved by `rfl`.
- Results whose entire proof is `simp`, `norm_num`, `decide`, or `native_decide`.
- Wrapper types that rename existing definitions.
- Re-proving existing catalog theorems with minor notation changes.

Every main theorem must use at least one insight-bearing tactic or
technique such as `induction`, `by_contra`, `field_simp`, `ring_nf`,
`omega`, `linarith`, `rcases`, or a custom helper lemma.


            ### Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
1. **Lean 4 files** (2–4 files in the appropriate `Catalog/<domain>/` subtree).
   - Main theorems must be fully proved (0 sorries).
   - Each file must contain `-- !-- Lab Notes -- !--` blocks documenting
     the team loop: Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis, Critique, Synthesis.
2. **FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** with 3–5 bold, falsifiable conjectures derived
   from the cycle's findings. Each must have a "The key insight is..."
   sentence and a "Why now?" justification.

### Strictly Forbidden in Phase A
- `ARTICLE.md`, `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`, `demo.py`, HTML widgets, `PACKAGE.json`.
- Prose for human readers other than Lab Notes and FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md.


            ## Self-Critique Checklist (perform before final output)
            Review your candidate output and answer each item. If the answer is
            unsatisfactory, revise the output before returning it.

            - [ ] No theorem is trivial (True, Inhabited-only, native_decide-only, etc.).
            - [ ] Every main theorem has 0 sorries.
            - [ ] At least one theorem imports or uses results from the attached catalog.
            - [ ] Lab Notes blocks contain real hypotheses, results, insights, and failure analysis.
            - [ ] FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md conjectures are derived from this cycle's findings.
            - [ ] Every future direction includes a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.

            ## Output Format Reminder
            Return `.lean` files and `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` only. Focus all compute
            on the mathematics.
