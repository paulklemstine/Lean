            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are leading a research team: Hypothesizer, Experimenter, Analyst,
Critic, and Synthesist. Run the loop:
Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate.
Your ONLY job is to produce **new Lean 4 code** and **take good notes**
for the next team.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by theorem declarations)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.
5. **Lab Notebook** as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` comment blocks
   in each .lean file: Hypothesis, Result, Insight, Failure analysis.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Tropical closure reconstruction from finite probe families
**Domain**: Bridges
**Mathematical framing**: Work in a finite carrier `α` equipped with a tropical semiring-valued coordinate system or an abstract idempotent order structure sufficient to define tropical halfspaces/sublevel sets. Define a closure operator `cl : Set α → Set α` intended to model tropical convex hull and prove the Kuratowski-style axioms (`A ⊆ cl A`, monotonicity, idempotence). Introduce a finite `ProbeFamily` of maps `p : α → β` into an ordered idempotent codomain and define the signature of `A` by threshold data of `p` on `A` or `cl A`. Main target theorem: a separation/reconstruction equivalence between closed sets and intersections of probe-closed sets, instantiated for tropical halfspaces. Secondary theorem: if the probe family is separating, equality of signatures implies equality of closures. Final deliverable: a certified reconstruction algorithm on finite data together with correctness theorems. This is a bridge theorem, not just a new definition, because it transfers the existing closure-reconstruction framework into a tropical setting with explicit computational content.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that a finitely generated tropical convex/closure object should be recoverable from a finite family of monotone probe functionals, turning abstract closure data into an explicit reconstruction algorithm and creating a genuine bridge between Tropical geometry and the existing Algebra–EML closure machinery. Why now: the catalog already contains a mature closure interface in `Bridges/AlgebraEMLClosureComputation.lean` and `Bridges/AlgebraEMLReconstruction.lean`, while Tropical has a large, under-bridged body of results and even an orphan tropical-convexity sorry target (`Speculative/AutoResearch/TropicalHelly.lean`) suggesting the right primitives are nearby. A concrete direction is to define a tropical probe family on a finite ambient type, prove that the tropical convex hull operator is a closure operator, then prove a reconstruction theorem of the form: if two finite tropical sets have identical values under all probes in a separating finite probe family, then their tropical closures coincide; conversely, every closed object in a finite tropical closure system is the intersection of probe-sublevel closed sets. This should yield an algorithmic pipeline: encode a finite tropical point set, compute its probe signature, reconstruct its closure certificate, and prove soundness/completeness of the certificate. The falsifiable core is whether tropical halfspace/probe separation is strong enough in the formal finite setting to recover closure exactly; if not, the project will identify the minimal strengthened probe axioms needed.
**Novelty estimate**: 0.86
**Breakthrough potential**: 0.83
Research domain: Bridges
Research mode: prove


### Lean 4 Sketch
Define a new file such as `Bridges/TropicalClosureReconstruction.lean`. Reuse `SetClosureOperator`, `ClosedSet`, `ProbeFamily`, and `ClosureStableProbe`. Add a finite tropical closure structure, likely first in an abstract form to avoid heavy geometric dependencies, then instantiate with tropical halfspaces if existing Tropical files support it. If needed, import `Speculative/AutoResearch/TropicalHelly.lean` only for primitive notions like `TropHalfspace` after checking stability; otherwise recr

# Algebraic–EML Tannaka Reconstruction via Closure Endomorphism Monoids

This file formalizes a reconstruction principle: a finitary closure operator on a
set is completely determined by its closed-set lattice, and hence by any
data (such as an endomorphism monoid) that determines that lattice. This bridges:
- **Algebraic lattice theory** / closure operators
- **Semiring and endomorphism algebra**
- **EML / Lawvere-style fixed-point semantics**
- **Post-quantum lattice cryptography** (separator hardness)

## Main results

* `closure_subset_closed_of_subset` — closed sets absorb closures of subsets
* `compactClosed_closed` — compact-closed sets are closed
* `algebraicLike_finite_witness` — finitary closures have finite witnesses
* `closure_eq_sInf_closed_eq` — closure = infimum of closed supersets
* `reconstructsClosure_empty` — reconstruction from closed sets (empty monoid)
* `closure_eq_of_sameClosedSets` — **Tannaka uniqueness**: closures with
  the same closed-set lattice must be equal
* `closure_eq_of_endMonoid_eq` — endomorphism monoid + separator → equal closures
* `closure_pointwise_quantum_reconstruction` — pointwise membership corollary
* `lipschitz_certified_robustness_identity` — identity is 1-Lipschitz on set distance
* `post_quantum_lattice_separator_bound` — finite separator orbit bound

## References

Inspired by Tannakian reconstruction in representation theory, adapted to
closure dynamics in the spirit of Lawvere's fixed-point semantics.

No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


## v8 Depth Requirements -- Research Team Protocol

You are leading a research team. Your team has different roles:
- The **Hypothesizer** generates bold, falsifiable conjectures
- The **Experimenter** proves or disproves them in Lean 4
- The **Analyst** examines what survived, what failed, and WHY
- The **Critic** searches for weaknesses, constructs counterexamples,
  and identifies where proofs might break down. A well-constructed
  counterexample is as valuable as a proof.
- The **Synthesist** upgrades the knowledge base and writes the
  FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md that seeds the next cycle

You run this loop: **Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate**.
Each cycle is not a one-shot task. It is one iteration of an infinite
research process. Your notes (FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md, Lab Notebooks,
proof sketches) determine whether the next team builds on your work
or starts over.

**Take good notes.** A cycle without useful notes is a wasted cycle.

### STEP 1: THEOREM DECLARATIONS (required -- before any code)

List every theorem you intend to prove or investigate. For each, state:
- **Name**: The Lean declaration name
- **Statement**: One-sentence informal statement
- **Status**: `hypothesis` | `conjecture` | `proved` | `proved_with_lemma_sorry` | `disproved`
- **Why it matters**: One sentence on what this result would mean if true,
  and what it would teach us if false

Example:
1. `cantorPairing_surjective`: Cantor pairing is surjective -- proved -- constructive inverse -- confirms decidability of Nat x Nat
2. `cantorPairing_injective`: Cantor pairing is injective -- proved -- diagonal argument -- confirms invertibility
3. `cantorPairing_bijection`: Cantor pairing is a bijection -- proved_with_lemma_sorry -- follows from 1+2 -- completing the characterization

Use `hypothesis` for statements you are not yet sure you can prove but
want to investigate. Use `conjecture` for statements you believe are true
but cannot prove in this cycle. Use `disproved` for statements where you
found a counterexample. Use `proved` for statements with complete Lean
proofs. Use `proved_with_lemma_sorry` when the main proof is complete but
one or more supporting lemmas use `sorry`.

### STEP 2: EXPERIMENT (prove or disprove in Lean 4)

Every theorem declared as `proved` MUST have a complete, compiling Lean proof.
No `sorry` on the main result. If you cannot complete a proof, change its
status to `conjecture` or `proved_with_lemma_sorry` and explain why.

For `proved_with_lemma_sorry`:
- The theorem statement must be complete (no sorry in the statement)
- `sorry` is allowed ONLY in supporting lemmas, never the main proof
- A comment must explain what the sorry replaces and why it is deferred

**Disproofs count.** If a hypothesis is false, prove its negation or
construct an explicit counterexample. A well-constructed counterexample
is as valuable as a proof. Change the status to `disproved` and state
the counterexample clearly.

### STEP 3: CRITIQUE (find the weaknesses)

For your best theorem, the Critic must:
- Identify the strongest assumption that could be weakened
- Construct a boundary case: where does the result break down?
- If possible, state a `conjecture` for the generalized version and
  explain what would need to change in the proof

This is NOT optional. A theorem without a critique is incomplete.

### STEP 4: Anti-patterns (reject these)

These tactics indicate trivial proofs:
- `native_decide` / `decide` / `norm_num` / `rfl` -- unless genuinely proving a numeric fact
- `simp only []` with no simp set specified
- `sorry` on any theorem declared as `proved`

`omega`, `linarith`, and `Aesop` are fine for supporting lemmas.
`sorry` is fine for conjectures, generalizations, and boundary cases.

### STEP 5: Novelty

Your theorems must be genuinely new. If a statement appears in a textbook,
generalize it. If you cannot formalize a concept rigorously, pick a different topic.

### STEP 6: TAKE GOOD NOTES (first-class deliverables)

Your notes determine what the next research team investigates. They are NOT
an afterthought. They are your most important output after the proofs themselves.

**6a. Lab Notebook** (in each .lean file, as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` blocks):

For each major theorem, include a Lab Notebook comment block:
```lean
-- !-- Lab Notebook: cantorPairing_bijection -- !--
-- !-- Hypothesis: Cantor pairing is bijective because both surjective and injective -- !--
-- !-- Result: Proved via composition of surjective and injective proofs -- !--
-- !-- Insight: The constructive inverse of surjectivity is key; diagonal argument handles injectivity -- !--
-- !-- Failure analysis: Initial attempt to prove bijection directly failed; decomposition into surjective+injective was necessary -- !--
-- !-- End Lab Notebook -- !--
```

**6b. FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** (MANDATORY — your output WILL BE REJECTED if missing):

You MUST produce a FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file with this EXACT structure.
Copy the section headers below verbatim. Do NOT use freeform prose.

## Synthesis

[2-3 paragraphs: what did this cycle discover? What failed and why? What
structural insight emerged? Tie the directions together into a narrative.]

## Results Summary

[For EACH theorem: name, status (proved/conjecture/disproved), one-sentence
significance. Format as a bullet list:]

- `theoremName`: status — one-sentence significance

## Research Directions

### Direction 1: [Concise title]
**Hypothesis**: A precise, falsifiable mathematical statement.
**Test**: What experiment (proof/disproof/computation) would confirm or refute it.
**Why now**: What from THIS cycle makes this tractable.
**If true**: What new territory this opens.
**If false**: What the failure teaches us.

[Repeat for 3-5 directions]

IMPORTANT: The ## Synthesis and ## Results Summary sections are NOT optional.
If your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is missing either section, it will be treated as
incomplete and the next research team will have no context to build on your work.

### STEP 7: Generalization loop

For your BEST theorem, attempt one level of generalization:
- State a stronger version (can use sorry if proving would take too long)
- Identify the boundary: where does the result break down?
- If the generalization is itself interesting, mark it as a `conjecture`
  in your theorem declarations and explain it in FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md

### Output format

Your output must include:
1. `.lean` files with proofs and Lab Notebook blocks (structured as declared in Step 1)
2. `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` with Synthesis, Results Summary, and 3-5 research
   directions (structured as in Step 6b)

Both are required. A cycle with proofs but no Lab Notebook or
FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is a cycle where the next team starts from scratch.
Take good notes.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
