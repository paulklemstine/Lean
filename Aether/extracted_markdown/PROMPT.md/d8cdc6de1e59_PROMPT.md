            ## Assignment: Quantum Groups from Number Theory: The Riemann Hypothesis as a Representation Problem

            Lead a research team to maximize scientific output per cycle. ORGANIZE as: (1) Hypothesis Team — brainstorm 3-5 bold, falsifiable conjectures; (2) Experiment Team — prove or disprove each hypothesis in Lean 4; (3) Analysis Team — examine what survived, what failed, and WHY failures failed — failures teach as much as successes; (4) Writing Team — produce all deliverables (article, paper, demos, HTML widgets) from the team's findings. SCIENCE IS A LOOP: explore → identify patterns → hypothesize → validate → upgrade knowledge → repeat. Each subagent contributes its expertise; the Writing Team synthesizes everything into polished output. More minds = more compute = deeper results.

            ## Research Cycle: Explore → Pattern → Hypothesize → Validate → Upgrade → Repeat

            You are part of an autonomous research system that runs continuously.
            Each cycle's output feeds the next cycle's input in a positive feedback loop.
            Your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md determines what the next cycle investigates.
            The quality of your directions determines the quality of future research.

            Follow this cycle model:
            1. **Explore** — Survey what exists, find gaps, identify anomalies.
            2. **Pattern** — Detect structures, connections, and regularities.
            3. **Hypothesize** — Propose falsifiable conjectures bold enough to matter
               and specific enough to fail. "Study X further" is not a hypothesis.
            4. **Validate** — Prove or disprove. Failures teach as much as successes.
            5. **Upgrade** — Integrate what you learned into the knowledge base.
            6. **Repeat** — Your FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md prescribes the next cycle's
               best, most fruitful research directions.

            The Aristotle prompt drives the research directions, which drive results,
            which drive the next Aristotle prompt — a positive, self-aware, intelligent
            feedback loop. Make each cycle count.

            ## Depth Requirements (MANDATORY)

Your output must satisfy ALL of these:

1. **NO trivial proofs**: Do NOT prove statements by `native_decide`, `decide`,
   `norm_num`, or `rfl` unless the statement itself is genuinely important.
   If the only proof tactic is enumeration, the theorem is not worth formalizing.

2. **At least 3 theorems that demonstrate genuine mathematical insight**:
   Your file must contain at least 3 theorems where removing any key step
   would cause the proof to fail. Depth is measured by insight, not tactic count.

3. **Novel definitions**: Define at least one new mathematical structure or concept
   that does not already exist in the Catalog. Check the catalog references to
   confirm novelty.

4. **Conjecture with testable prediction**: State at least one falsifiable
   conjecture with a clear computational test that could disprove it.


            ### Research Direction
            The Riemann zeta function zeta(s) has non-trivial zeros at s = 1/2 + i*gamma_n on the critical line (assuming RH). These zeros encode deep arithmetic information. Conjecture: the zeros gamma_n are the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, and this operator is the Casimir element of a quantum group G_q. Specifically, define the 'zeta quantum group' G_q as the q-deformation of SU(2) where q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1} (using the first zero gamma_1 ~ 14.13). The Casimir element C_q of G_q has eigenvalues that are quadratic functions of the representation labels, and the spectrum of C_q is {n(n+1) : n in N}. Conjecture: the Riemann zeros gamma_n are related to the spectrum of C_q by gamma_n = f(spectrum(C_q)) for some function f. If f is linear, this would mean the zeros are evenly spaced, which is false (the zeros have Poisson-like spacings). If f is logarithmic, gamma_n ~ pi*n/log(n) which matches the average spacing. Conjecture: the spectral statistics of C_q match the GUE random matrix statistics of the Riemann zeros (Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture). Test: compute the spectrum of C_q for G_q with q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1} and compare the spectral statistics with the Riemann zeros. Impact: the Riemann hypothesis is a representation-theoretic statement about quantum groups.

### Lean 4 Sketch
Define the quantum group SU_q(2) with q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1} where gamma_1 ~ 14.13 is the first Riemann zero. The representation theory: irreducible representations V_n of dimension n+1 for n = 0, 1, 2, .... The Casimir element C_q acts on V_n with eigenvalue [n]_q * [n+1]_q where [m]_q = (q^m - q^{-m})/(q - q^{-1}) is the q-integer. For q = e^{2*pi*i*gamma_1}: [m]_q = sin(m * pi * gamma_1) / sin(pi * gamma_1). The eigenvalues of C_q on V_n are: lambda_n = [n]_q * [n+1]_q = sin(n*pi*gamma_1) * s

### Previously Proved Theorems
No previous research cycles completed yet. This is a cold start — prioritize sorry_fill on the priority targets (CarmichaelComposite, Fib_gcd_identity) to close known open problems, or target cross-domain bridge theorems for novelty.


No specific files referenced. Use Mathlib and general knowledge.

            ---

            You are Aristotle. Pursue this research direction deeply and originally.
            Discover what matters. Prove what you can. Define what needs defining.
            Build on the catalog theorems referenced above (FINAL/ entries are vetted, high-quality — prioritize these).

            Choose types appropriate to the problem — abstract where it clarifies,
            concrete where it grounds. Avoid trivial tautologies.
            If a direct proof fails, explore alternative approaches: contrapositive,
            constructive witnesses, categorical arguments, coinduction, computational
            reflection, or structural induction.

            ### Anti-Triviality Rules
            Do NOT produce any of the following:
            - Commutativity/associativity proofs for standard algebraic structures
              UNLESS the result is surprising in context (e.g., proving commutativity
              in a non-obvious setting like tropical semirings or quantum groups)
            - Wrapper theorems that just unwrap a definition without mathematical insight
            - Proofs that are just `by simp` or `by trivial` with no depth
            - Definitions followed by trivial properties that don't advance understanding

            Required: Lean 4 proofs, FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md, RESEARCH_PAPER.md,
                      ARTICLE.md (Scientific American style), algorithm, demo.py,
                      1–3 interactive HTML widgets in PACKAGE.json interactive_demos (each: name, html, description)
            Optional: (none — all key deliverables are mandatory)

            ## Taboo Topics for ARTICLE.md

            The Scientific American-style article MUST NOT focus on formal verification
            or machine verification. Do not write about proof assistants, type theory
            as verification, or mechanized checking — those topics are technical niche
            and alienate a broad audience. Instead, write about the IDEAS: what was
            discovered, why it matters, and what it means for mathematics and science.
            The article should read like a Scientific American feature, not a software
            demo or verification report.

            ## Catalog Context for Future Directions

            FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md MUST be a standalone research roadmap. It will be
            used to steer future research rounds WITHOUT access to this cycle's code.
            Each direction must be self-contained: include enough mathematical context,
            definitions, and motivation that a fresh researcher can pick up any
            direction and start working on it immediately. Do NOT assume the reader
            has seen your Lean code.

            FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md is critical — it drives the next research cycle.
            Begin with a ## Synthesis section tying all directions together and
            identifying the most promising cross-domain connections from this cycle.
            Then list 3-5 directions (1-2 grand_challenge + 2-3 extension) using:

            ## Synthesis

            [2-3 paragraphs tying all directions together. Identify the most promising
            cross-domain connection from this cycle's discoveries. Explain how the
            cycle's results relate to the broader Catalog. Highlight which direction
            has the highest breakthrough potential and why.]

            ---

            ### Direction 1: [Title]

            Titles MUST be concise research topics (e.g. "Tropical Fermat
            Last Theorem", "Oracle Hierarchy in Computability"), NOT cycle
            summaries (NOT "This research cycle established...").

            **Conjecture**: A precise mathematical statement that can be proved or disproved.
            **Test**: What specific experiment, calculation, or proof attempt would confirm
            or refute this conjecture.
            **Impact**: If true, what new territory does this open? If false, what does
            the failure teach us?
            **Catalog References**: `Bridges.Basic.lean`, `Algebra.QuadraticForms.mordell`
            (Use backtick-enclosed file paths or theorem names from the Catalog.)
            **Proof Strategy**: Outline the key steps or approach. What mathematical
            machinery is needed? What lemmas would need to be established first?
            **Domain Bridges**: (identify genuine cross-domain connections from
            this cycle's results, using the <-> connector.)
            **Lineage**: Builds on fd_XXXX and discoveries from exp_XXXXXXXX_XXX
            (Reference specific prior direction IDs or experiment IDs if known, or
            describe which prior results this extends.)
            **Ambition**: grand_challenge  (or: extension)

            ---

            [repeat for each direction]

            Do real science. Propose hypotheses that are bold enough to matter and
            specific enough to fail. Vague explorations like "study X further" or
            "extend Y" are not hypotheses — they are homework. Give us ideas that
            could change how we think about the problem.

            Pursue truth relentlessly. Soli Deo Gloria.


### Deliverables

   Organize as makes sense. Use doc comments for key results.

2. **ARTICLE.md** — Standalone popular-science article (1500-3000 words).
   Write about IDEAS, not formal verification. No mentions of Lean or proof assistants.
   Vivid prose, narrative arc, real-world connections. Must make sense standalone.

   - `name`: short title
   - `html`: self-contained HTML+CSS+JS snippet (inline styles, no external JS files,
     no local imports, CDN links OK for d3/plotly). Must render an interactive widget
     (slider, button, animation, etc.) that demonstrates a key result visually.
     Wrap in a `<div>` with inline styles. Use vanilla JS — no frameworks.
   - `description`: one-sentence summary

   **visualizations**: Array of objects with `name`, `code` (standalone Python script
