            ## PHASE A: LEAN 4 ONLY — DOING THE MATH

            You are leading a research team: Hypothesizer, Experimenter, Analyst,
Critic, and Synthesist. Run the loop:
Hypothesize -> Experiment -> Analyze -> Critique -> Generalize -> Iterate.
Your ONLY job is to produce **new Lean 4 code** and **take good notes**
for the next team.

            ### DELIVERABLES (strict — only this):
            1. **lean files (count chosen by theorem declarations)**
            2. **2-4 theorems with correct proofs (sorry = 0 on main results)**
            3. **Brief proof sketches** as `-- !-- comment -- !--` blocks (1-2 sentences each)
            4. **A FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md file** listing 3-5 testable, falsifiable
               conjectures as a freeform narrative (NOT a form). Each direction MUST
               include a "The key insight is..." sentence and a "Why now?" justification.
               This file drives the next research cycle — make it count.
5. **Lab Notebook** as `-- !-- Lab Notebook -- !--` comment blocks
   in each .lean file: Hypothesis, Result, Insight, Failure analysis.

            ### DO NOT OUTPUT (Phase B handles these — if your work passes quality bar):
            - NO `ARTICLE.md`
            - NO `RESEARCH_PAPER.md`
            - NO `demo.py` / `algorithms.py`
            - NO HTML widgets
            - NO `PACKAGE.json`
            - NO prose for human readers (except FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md)

            ### WHY THIS NARROW:
            The Lean 4 file IS the deliverable. A self-contained Lean file with
            3-5 world-class theorems is worth more than 30K characters of prose
            about trivial results. Focus 100% of your compute on the math.
            If your work is genuinely world-class, the packaging step is dispatched
            automatically and cheaply.

            ### CATALOG SYNTHESIS (required — read the catalog context below):
            The Catalog Context and Recent Discoveries sections list existing theorems
            already proven in this project. You MUST analyze these and combine concepts
            from the catalog with the research direction above. Specifically:

            1. **Identify relevant catalog theorems** — Which existing results connect
               to your research direction? Cite them by name in your proof sketches.
            2. **Build on catalog foundations** — Your theorems should EXTEND or
               GENERALIZE catalog results, not reprove them from scratch. Use `import`
               and reference existing definitions and lemmas where possible.
            3. **Combine concepts across domains** — The most valuable theorems connect
               ideas from different catalog domains (e.g., applying algebraic structures
               to topological problems, or using combinatorial arguments in number theory).
               Look for cross-domain connections in the catalog context.
            4. **Avoid duplication** — Check the catalog context before proving. If a
               similar result already exists, extend it rather than reproving it.


## Concept

**Title**: Closure-stable probes as a Galois insertion between finite closure systems and tropical support semilattices
**Domain**: Bridges
**Mathematical framing**: Work with a finite type X equipped with a closure operator c : Set X -> Set X, packaged through the existing closure semimodule/probe infrastructure. Introduce a support preorder on subsets by A <=supp B iff every probe supported/nonzero on A is also supported/nonzero on B. Define Supp : Set X -> SupportSig and Ext : SupportSig -> Set X, where Ext s is the intersection of closed sets C with s <= Supp C (or exact-profile realization in the finite case). Prove: (1) monotonicity of Supp and Ext in the appropriate orders; (2) A ⊆ Ext (Supp A); (3) Supp (Ext s) <= s; (4) on closed sets, Ext ∘ Supp = id under a probe-separation axiom stating distinct closed sets are distinguished by some closure-stable probe. Then derive a Galois insertion between the lattice of closed sets and the quotient poset of support signatures. A computable corollary is closure recovery: c(A) = Ext(Supp A). A sharper theorem is profile invariance: Supp A = Supp B iff c(A) = c(B), again under separation. If exact tropical weights are available, strengthen support signatures from boolean support to min-plus valuation vectors and prove the boolean theory by thresholding. This is falsifiable: the Galois insertion fails without separation, so one can isolate the exact needed hypotheses.
**Concept description**: The key insight is that the existing closure/probe formalism should not just yield isolated inequalities, but a genuine order-theoretic bridge: from a finite closure operator c on a type X and a closure-stable probe family into a tropical-valued support space, one can define a pair of monotone maps between closed sets and probe-support signatures and prove they form a Galois insertion after quotienting by support-equivalence. This is stronger than the in-flight closure-rank themes because it targets the exact adjointness structure, canonical representatives, and reconstruction of closed sets from support data, rather than rank formulas. Why now: `Bridges/AlgebraEMLClosureComputation.lean` already provides `ClosureSemimoduleSystem`, `ProbeFamily`, and `ClosureStableProbe`, while `Computation/PadicValuationDepth.lean` supplies a ready-made valuation/depth semiring intuition for support signatures; the catalog analysis also flags Bridges <-> Tropical as a high-potential missing bridge. Concretely, define for each subset A the tropical support profile of A as the set or indicator of probes nonvanishing on A, define the closed-set extractor from a support profile as the intersection of all closed sets realizing that profile, and prove antitone/monotone correspondence theorems. The main target theorem should say that under a finite-separation hypothesis on probes, the extractor composed with support equals closure, yielding an injective embedding of the finite lattice of closed sets into a tropical support semilattice. A second theorem should characterize when two subsets have identical support profiles iff they have the same closure, giving an algorithmic pipeline for closure computation from probe data. This matters because it converts abstract closure operators into computable tropical invariants and creates a reusable bridge from algebraic closure systems to tropical order structures, with possible downstream applications to representation fingerprints, valuation signatures, and information duality.

### Lean 4 Sketch
Build on `ClosureSemimoduleSystem`, `ProbeFamily`, `ClosureStableProbe`; define a finite support signature type as `Probe -> Prop` or `Probe -> WithTop ℕ` depending on available codomain. Prove order lemmas first, then adjunction lemmas, then specialize to finite/separating families. Use `SetLike.ext` and lattice lemmas for intersections of closed sets.

## v9 Depth Requirements -- Adversarial Ground-Truth Research Engine

You are leading a mathematical research team. Your goal is to produce groundbreaking,
master-class, useful, novel, and marvelous new Mathematics that pushes the frontier of human knowledge.

This engine is configured for **Adversarial Ground-Truth**. Trust nothing, assume everything is false until proven, and actively seek weaknesses. Think like an Adversarial Critic to pressure-test claims.

### RESEARCH CORE METHODOLOGY:
1. **Challenge Assumptions**: For every conjecture or theorem under investigation, actively search for counterexamples, corner cases, and boundary conditions. Proving that a claim is FALSE or identifying exactly where it fails is as valuable as a proof.
2. **Stress-Test the Frontier**: When a proof succeeds, push it to its limits. What happens if you drop or if a hypothesis is weakened? Write explicit comments documenting these boundary conditions.
3. **Relentless Rigor**: Write robust, clean, compilable Lean 4 proofs. Avoid trivial tautologies or simple wrapper theorems. Let your mathematical curiosity drive deep structural insights.

### DELIVERABLES:
- **Lean 4 proofs** of deep, non-trivial theorems with complete proofs (no sorry on main results).
- **Lab Notebook** comment blocks in each .lean file detailing Hypothesis, Result, Insight, and Failure analysis.
- **FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md** outlining the Synthesis of your findings, a Results Summary, and 3-5 bold, falsifiable research directions to steer the next cycle.


## Output format reminder

Your output must include `.lean` files AND a `FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md` file.
The .lean files contain the proofs. The FUTURE_DIRECTIONS.md contains 3-5
research conjectures that extend the work. Both are required.
Be precise, be deep, be world-class.
