# Large Integer Factoring: A Brainstorm and Outside-Index-Calculus Survey

**Status:** research survey / kill record. No new factoring algorithm was found.
**Scope:** classical (non-quantum) general-purpose large-integer factoring, plus the
adjacent partial-key and complexity-theory literature.
**Machine-checked companions:** `NegativeResults.lean`, `FreeSymbol.lean` in this
directory; barrier corrections in `TradeoffBarrier.lean` and `Capstone.lean`.

---

## 1. Bottom line

Across two rounds of brainstorming and an adversarial steelman/refutation sweep
(≈16 parallel research threads), **every proposed classical route to factoring —
inside or outside the index-calculus / NFS family — resolves to one of three
things:**

1. **Already classical** (repackaged Gauss / Lagrange / Shanks / Williams).
2. **Provably equivalent** to a known hard object (e.g. computing a class-group
   regulator, which *is* the factoring problem in disguise).
3. **Genuinely open but blocked** by a specific, non-fatal obstacle (partial-key
   exposure, analog precision, the low-exponent-RSA complexity ceiling).

The correct scientific outcome for "invent a never-before-seen factoring method" is
therefore **a kill record and a corrected barrier model**, not an algorithm. This
document is that record. The one durable positive result is the correction in §5:
the Catalog's own AM–GM "trade-off barrier" had been over-read, and the corrected
reading is now propagated into the formal documentation.

## 2. State of the art (context for every claim below)

- **General number field sieve (GNFS):** `L[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3} ≈ 1.923]` — unchanged.
- **Special number field sieve (SNFS):** `L[1/3, (32/9)^{1/3} ≈ 1.526]` — for special-form `N`.
- **ECM:** `L_p[1/2, √2]`.
- **Deterministic general factoring:** Harvey, *Math. Comp.* 2021, `O(N^{1/5} log^{16/5} N)` —
  rigorous but exponential, so **not** RSA-relevant.
- **No polynomial-time classical general-purpose factoring algorithm is known**, and
  none is produced here.
- **Structured moduli:** the one clean polynomial-time result is Boneh–Durfee–
  Howgrave-Graham (CRYPTO 1999) for `N = p^r q` — a *prime **power*** structure
  (`p` repeated `r` times). This is often conflated with "multi-prime RSA is
  polytime-factorable": it is **not** (Hinek–Low–Teske — attacks get *strictly
  worse* with more equal-size primes), and **Mersenne/equal-bit multi-prime RSA is
  not known to be polytime-factorable.** Standard RSA is not threatened.

## 3. Round 1 — the brainstorm (7 ideas), all killed or classical

| # | Proposed direction | Verdict | Why it dies |
|---|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reciprocal / Gauss-sum phase** — read the factor off `arg` of a quadratic Gauss sum mod `N`. | **Classical / zero info** | The genuine Gauss-sum phase is a 4th root of unity fixed by `N mod 4` and small residue symbols, all polynomial-time, carrying **zero** bits about `p,q`. The proposed "double twist" is not even multiplicative. Machine-checked core: `NegativeResults.mod4_not_injective`. Ref: Murty, *Evaluation of the Quadratic Gauss Sum*. |
| 2 | **Self-similar / "unbounded arity" sieve tower** — beat `L[1/k,c]` with `k = π(B)`. | **Known + a modelling artifact** | This is Schirokauer's **Tower NFS** (2000) + special-`q` descent. Even for arbitrary extension degree the complexity is still `L[1/3, (64/9)^{1/3}]`. The claimed polynomial escape omits the Dickman factor `1/ρ(u)`; for `k = π(B)` the true relation-collection cost is `≈ √N`. See §5. |
| 3 | **Real-quadratic infrastructure / CF-period parity** — one parity bit of the period of `√N` as a factor oracle. | **Classical, wrong tool** | The parity theorem is **Lagrange/Legendre (1760s–1785)**: a negative-Pell *solvability* criterion, not a factoring oracle. On RSA semiprimes the bit is free/uninformative, and one bit cannot factor an `n`-bit modulus. The `N^{1/4}` partial step is **SQUFOF** (Shanks 1969). The BSGS fast path needs the regulator, and computing the regulator reduces to factoring. Ref: Rippon–Taylor 2004; Gower–Wagstaff 2008. |
| 4 | **Precomputation-amortized factoring** — universal factor base / batched sieve to break the exponent. | **Constant only** | Amortization moves only the constant `c` (GNFS `1.923` → Coppersmith's factory `1.639`), never the exponent `ρ = 1/3`. Practical realizable gains are `≈ 2×` (Mersenne factory). Ref: Bernstein–Lange 2014/921; Kleinjung–Bos–Lenstra 2014/653. |
| 5 | **Genus-character single-bit reduction** — factor `N` from one nonprincipal quadratic character. | **Classical repackaging** | The content is Gauss's genus theory (1801). Its formalizable core is the one-line multiplicativity `(a/p)(a/q) = (a/pq)` — now proved in `FreeSymbol.lean`. One line is the evidence it is repackaging, not new mathematics. Ref: Gauss 1801; Cox, *Primes of the Form x²+ny²*. |
| 6 | **Analog / physical-precision factoring** | **Open but capped** | The one genuinely open thread. Blocked by precision-vs-information limits and the Moore-simulation cap: an analog device faces an exponential wall long before it beats `L[1/3,·]`. No credible classical poly-time path. |
| 7 | **Circuit-lower-bound argument** (`FACTOR ∉ TC⁰`, natural-proofs barrier) | **Open, but not a method** | A genuine complexity-theory program (template: `PRIMES ∉ AC⁰[p]`), but it yields a *separation*, not a factoring algorithm. |

## 4. Round 2 — outside the index-calculus / NFS family

The steelman pass actively tried to *rescue* each area, then refuted the rescue.

- **Group theory (class number, units, genus, BSGS):** **DEAD (loses on the
  exponent).** All equivariant / baby-step-giant-step machinery is
  Lagarias–Odlyzko-class; the regulator is the expensive object, and computing it is
  equivalent to factoring. *Precise nuance:* the **imaginary-quadratic class-group**
  method (Lenstra–Pomerance) is the **one rigorous, unconditional,
  non-index-calculus subexponential factoring method** — `L[1/2, 1]` — but GNFS's
  `L[1/3,·]` strictly beats it. So it is a real method, just asymptotically
  dominated.
- **Transcendence / geometry of numbers:** **DEAD.** Siegel's effect kills the
  small-unit regime these methods need.
- **Analytic number theory (L-functions, spectral, circle method):** **DEAD.**
  Recovers the same `B²`-vs-`E²` smoothness/linear-algebra balance under another
  name — same `L[1/3,·]`.
- **Coding theory:** **DEAD**, but the *premise was partly confounded.* There is no
  Stern "factoring via codes" paper; Williams's "singular modulus" is a p±1
  smoothness scheme, not a code scheme. The no-code-route conclusion survives; the
  mechanism was corrected. Ref: HAC 3.30.
- **Lattices:** **DEAD for a random modulus; partial-information only.** No lattice
  method factors a random modulus faster than GNFS. Every lattice theorem is a
  *partial-information* theorem (Coppersmith's founding paper is literally
  titled "…Factoring with High Bits Known"). The one real polynomial-time *lattice
  factoring* claim is **Schnorr 2021** (ePrint 2021/933, "This destroys the RSA
  cryptosystem") — it rests on named unproved heuristics (Geometrical Sphere
  Assumption, shortest-vector shape) and was **empirically falsified**: Ducas
  implemented it (SchnorrGate) and found **0 factoring relations in 1000 trials**
  at the claimed target parameter. *Careful framing:* the correct claim is
  "**unproven and empirically falsified (2021)**," **not** "formally refuted by a
  theorem" (Ajtai STOC 2003, the one key paper, was not obtained). *(This also
  corrects a common conflation: the Nguyen–Stern 2001 attack forges Schnorr
  **signatures** in the identification setting — it does **not** touch the factoring
  claim, which rests on a different lattice and problem.)* **Corrected barrier:** the
  limit is **epistemic**, not probabilistic — the monic quadratic `F(x)=(x−p) mod N`
  *would* be caught by the proven `N^{1/2}` bound at `δ=2`, but **you cannot write it
  down because you don't know `p`.** With a hint you build a degree-1 `f(x)=x+p̃`
  whose bound applies to the *error* `|p−p̃| ≤ N^{1/4}` — i.e. "you must already
  know half the bits of `p`." The `N^{1/d}` formula is not a ceiling imposed on you;
  it reflects that `p` is an unknown `N^{1/2}`-sized quantity with no polynomial to
  construct. **Partial-key (Coppersmith/HNP) is the one genuinely open, non-equivalent
  technique** — it factors *broken* keys, not sound RSA, and is orthogonal to the
  sound-key question. *Honesty note on the bounds:* the Boneh–Durfee `0.292` is
  **heuristic by the authors' own words** ("we cannot state our attack as a theorem");
  `1/4` is **Wiener's**; Heninger–Shacham's `0.27` is **not a lattice result** and is
  heuristic; the ⅓-of-CRT-exponents result (May–Nowakowski–Sarkar 2022) is rigorous
  for the MSB case but heuristic for LSB and contested in the headline regime
  (Takayasu–Kunihiro). None is a theorem for sound RSA.
- **Complexity ceiling (evidence, not a method):** Boneh–Venkatesan gives
  model-restricted evidence that breaking **low-exponent** RSA may be **easier than
  factoring** — reinforcing that "recover the factor" is not the only attack
  surface, but it is not itself a new factoring algorithm.

## 5. The load-bearing correction (the one durable positive result)

The Catalog's `TradeoffBarrier.lean` proved, correctly, an AM–GM theorem:

> A `k`-way multiplicative trade-off with budgets `∏ yᵢ = x` costs at least
> `k·exp(x^{1/k})`, and the exponent `1/k` is the AM–GM balance point.

The **interpretation** that crept into the docstrings — "the sieve exponent `1/k`
is forced by AM–GM, and `k = 3` gives NFS" — is **wrong**, in a way that made
"unbounded arity" look like an escape hatch. Two errors:

1. **The model omits the Dickman factor `1/ρ(u)`** — the number of candidate tests
   actually needed to *produce* one smooth relation. Smoothness probability, not
   the number of stages, is what pins the subexponential cost in practice.
2. **The `1/3` of the NFS is not an AM–GM balance over three stages.** It is the
   optimum of a smoothness-probability vs. linear-algebra balance (minimize
   `B² + E²` subject to `E²·Prob ≥ B^{1+o(1)}`; Barbulescu–Gaudry–Kleinjung), and
   that balance is **insensitive to arity**. Arity buys the constant `c`, never
   the exponent.

So "`k = 3` gives NFS" records a *shape*, not a *mechanism*, and "unbounded arity
escapes the barrier" is an artifact of an under-specified model, not a route to
faster factoring. **This correction is now propagated into the `TradeoffBarrier.lean`
and `Capstone.lean` docstrings.** The theorems themselves are untouched and remain
valid statements *about their model*; only the over-reading was wrong.

---

## 6. Machine-checked companions

- **`NegativeResults.lean`** — a cited kill record (the table above) plus a
  machine-checked support for the Gauss-sum kill: `mod4_not_injective` shows the
  map `n ↦ n mod 4` fails to separate the distinct semiprimes `15 = 3·5` and
  `39 = 3·13`, so a low-order residue observable cannot carry factoring information.
- **`FreeSymbol.lean`** — the free-symbol lemma `(a/pq) = (a/p)(a/q)`: the product is
  computable from `a` and `pq` alone, while each Legendre factor needs a prime in
  isolation. Also `jacobi_neg_one_disagrees`, the symbolic form of **Shor's
  condition** (a Jacobi symbol of `-1` forces the two local symbols to be opposite),
  which is why the quantum route factors exactly when the two local characters
  disagree.

Both files compile clean against built Mathlib (Lean v4.33.1, `~/prove2me_workspace`).

## 7. Open threads worth continuing (the "do not give up" list)

These are the *live* edges, in rough order of promise. None is a new factoring
algorithm; each is a place where a genuine open problem still lives.

1. **Coppersmith / HNP partial-key exposure** — the only place a non-equivalent,
   truly open technique sits. The barrier is **epistemic**: a hint about `p` turns
   the problem into finding a *small root*, but the classical `N^{1/d}` bounds
   apply to the *error* in your hint, so progress = "how many bits of `p` must you
   already know." Current honest state: `1/4` is **Wiener's** (theorem);
   Boneh–Durfee `0.292` and Heninger–Shacham `0.27` are **heuristic** by the
   authors' own disclaimers (H-S is not even a lattice result); the ⅓-CRT result is
   rigorous for MSB, heuristic/contested for LSB. The sharp open problem is to
   find a *rigorous* bound that beats `1/4` for `d` (or to prove none exists), and
   to characterize which realistic side-channel leaks cross the current wall.
   (Partial-key only; not sound RSA.)
2. **Is low-exponent RSA easier than factoring?** — the Boneh–Venkatesan ceiling
   question: does breaking `e`-small RSA reduce to factoring, or genuinely to
   something easier? A model-independent separation would be a real result.
3. **Analog / physical-precision factoring** — the honest open thread. The
   precision-vs-information and Moore-simulation caps are the crux; sharpen them
   into a bound.
4. **Circuit lower bounds for factoring** — the `FACTOR ∉ TC⁰` program. Narrow
   (yielding a separation, not an algorithm) but genuinely open and squarely in
   the spirit of the Catalog.
5. **Modular-curve / étale-cohomology unification** — the classical link between
   factoring and the étale cohomology of modular curves (monodromy, Quillen–
   Lichtenbaum) is a real structural thread; it does not beat `L[1/3,·]` but it
   explains *why* the sieve balance is the balance, tying back to §5.

---

## 8. Verdict

> No credible non-index-calculus route to polynomial-time classical RSA factoring
> was found; the space is well-explored, and the most useful output of the search
> is a precise map of *why* each escape route is closed. The Catalog's own
> barrier documentation was corrected as a direct result (§5).

The next honest move is to sharpen the open threads in §7, not to relitigate the
killed directions in §3–§4.
