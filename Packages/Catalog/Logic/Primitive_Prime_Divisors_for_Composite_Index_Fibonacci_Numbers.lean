This catalog entry is not Lean source: what was checked in here is a unified `diff`
fragment (a patch against a file in `Speculative/AutoResearch/`), which cannot be
elaborated.  The original text is preserved verbatim inside this comment so that no
content is lost; the mathematics it refers to — the rank of apparition and primitive
prime divisors of Fibonacci numbers — is developed and fully proved in
`Shared/Primitive_Prime_Divisors_for_Composite_Index_Fibonacci_Numbers.lean`.
